<dd id="l0h21m50s">You have to give me the answer. I can give you two clues, like two words, and you buzz in and tell me what the words are. Here's a hint. Here's a clue: all the answers are the same. Okay, so like, for instance, if I were to say, the rear part of your chest and what a fire does-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h21m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h23m57s">Brick bray, yes! One more. One more. To get stoned and to get stoned. It's bake blaze. Anyway, Bakeblaze is an unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs. It can backup fanart, fanfic, music, photos, videos, drawings, documents, all of your data. You can restore by mail. If you crash, they'll send you a hard drive. It's amazing.

<dt><a href="#l0h24m31s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h24m31s">Thank you, Bakeblaze, for your sponsorship. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h24m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h24m31s">All right. Let me get through the next few announcements really quick, then. You guys got to see a video before this that Geek and Sundry put together. It was a fun weekend shoot to talk about the game Masquerada. I talked about it in previous episodes, but it's an awesome PC RPG. I am so in love with the process of us putting this together. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h24m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h24m31s">It's a great story, fantastic cast, incredible writing, and very much hearkens to the isometric, Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment-style RPG format of the early 2000s. I highly recommend it. You should check it out. I think it's in Steam now, and hope you like it. Next up, my first episode of the new GM Tips series is out today. It goes a little behind my screen, and gives some ideas as to how you can set up your own GM circumstance and experience. Mind you, most of it's just fluff. You don't need any of that to run a game. You can just have books, dice, paper, and pens, and you're good to go. But these are just suggestions and an example of the things that I do to run my game smoothly, and you should check it out if you'd like it. New episodes will be coming out every Wednesday on Alpha, I suppose, and then on Thursdays coming out on YouTube and the website proper. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h24m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h25m50s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h25m50s">Is it pronounced GM tips, or gmmm tips? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h25m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h25m53s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h25m53s">Gmmm tips. They are now. It is now Matthew Mercer's Gmmm Tips. Thank you, Travis. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h25m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h25m53s">Disadvantage. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h25m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h26m4s">So check that out. Also, my last announcement for me. There's a project up on Kickstarter right now called Open Legend RPG. It's a cool new RPG system. Both myself and Ed Greenwood, the creator of Faerun and the Forgotten Realms, are contributing to this project. It looks pretty cool, people involved are really nice, and go ahead and check it out, see if it's your jam. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h26m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h26m4s">And if it is, you should go ahead and help support it, so check it out. It's Open Legend RPG. That's all my announcements. Does anybody else have anything they want to talk about? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h26m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h29m28s">Welcome back, everyone. I just physically ordered the other torch, so that'll be fixed soon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h29m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h29m28s">Because sometimes you just got to do it yourself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h29m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h29m28s">Anyway, welcome back. So to continue from where we left off for tonight's episode of Critical Role, Vox Machina, our heroic players and characters, in fighting their way across the land of Tal'Dorei against the Chrome Conclave, a gathering of ancient chromatic dragons that have torn the current civilization asunder. They've gathered a number of artifacts of old called the Vestiges of Divergence and recently made allies with one of these dragons, Raishan, the green dragon of the conclave, apparently interested in revolting against the conclave's leader, Thordak the Cinder King. A tentative alliance has been forged and to prove both the stalwartness of that alliance, as well as to further your agenda against the conclave, you all traveled back to Wildemount, to the ruins of Draconia. With the help of the Ravenites you set a trap for Vorugal, the Frigid Doom. You summoned, using your single Gate scroll, from the Abyss, Yenk the Goristro, a great, powerful siege demon and caused it to battle with the white dragon. Partway through, the encounter got more intense, you all rushed into the fray. Got the crap kicked out of you in a lot of cases but when all was said and done, with the aid of Raishan, you felled Vorugal. The final shot being landed by Vex'ahlia herself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h29m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h31m7s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h31m7s">You guys have now taken a moment. You've discussed with Raishan to meet back in Whitestone, after which she reverted form and vanished. And you've now begun to collect your spoils and gather what you can from the battlefield at this moment. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h31m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h31m7s">So that's where we pick up this week. What would you like to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h31m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And they're all approaching and climbing up the sides of the throne to get to the top. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=0h39m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It's left this really interesting sculpture that they've torn everything away from.

<dd id="l2h35m47s">The weather has cleared up. There's breaks in the clouds. It's still mostly cloud-covered, but you do see glimpses of blue sky here and there. Still cold, still see your breath out in the air. But the temperature does feel slightly warmer than it was the day before. You begin to walk down to the ravine center on the north side of the ravine where Vorugal's lair once resided. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=2h35m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h35m47s">You can see hundreds of footprints, up and down, through the snow, through the ravine; looks like there's been a lot of foot traffic to and from while you guys were resting. You make your way to the ice throne of Vorugal and you see a portion of it has collapsed inward. But you also see a lot of foot traffic around, most of the ice spires that remained up there have been broken. The remaining Draconian corpses that were adorning them were taken down, or aren't in sight. And you can see there are a few remaining dragonborn Ravenites that are stepping in and out of the cavern-like chamber that you largely punched through and they continued to excavate it into the night. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=2h35m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h37m13s">He looks for a second and says, "It is nothing for us. But we've worked around it." He points down, and you can see the portion of it that has collapsed, filled in part at the side and shoveled out in these large chunks of ice that are sitting outside of this cavern area. Parts of the ship have been moved around-- it looks like it's been somewhat damaged. It's not a full ship. It's a large portion of a ship. It looks like in whatever battle or attack that Vorugal took this ship, it destroyed a huge portion of it in doing so and took the rest of it with it, in pieces. And it is a very pretty ship. It looks like it may have been the jewel of a navy somewhere. And here it resides. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=2h37m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h37m13s">However, it does appear like the ship has seen many moons since it was originally taken, if that makes any sense. Like, it wasn't brought directly here.

<dd id="l2h39m13s">It is Dwarven, and as Pike begins reading around it, this-- it's the name of the ship across the mast, which is "The Floebreaker." This ship appears to have been, at least in some way, shape, or form, designed as a means of travelling through very far north icy regions, meant to break through elements of heavy glacier flows and such. The construction of it, as you get closer to the actual bit of the ship that is there, you can see it's very heavily reinforced with metal and has a very rigid structure to it. The fine scrolling that you saw before, it looks to be partially filled with ice at times. So as soon as it broke away, you could see it's actually more of a harsh, broken Dwarvish runic writing to it. The ship has definitely seen a lot of wear and tear. That's about as much you can make out of it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=2h39m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And from underneath, you can see where once there was a heavy amount of cropland that has all died off because of the recent freeze that came with Vorugal. You take the eight hours to concentrate and as you, do you enrich the land. You can watch as many of these dead seeds come to life with green once more. Suddenly, you see sprouting bits of delicious cabbages and other forms of produce begin to spring to life and grow nutrient rich. As this happens, you can see a few of the Ravenites who followed you to watch this are taken aback and excitedly rush down to tell the rest of the people.

<dd id="l2h59m10s">Yes. I don't know, I think he focused for so long on the betrayal of his love, on all of the horrible things within himself that caused that, that he became the physical embodiment of it. And I think he was trying to do the same thing to me. Even though I refused him, I could feel those seeds being planted. Self-doubt and loathing echoing in my mind every night. Reliving every wrong that people have done to me and everything I have done. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=2h59m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h1m1s">I think so. I'm trying. It's the only thing I've tried that's made any sense so far. And it felt very liberating, it felt good, it felt perfect. And it wasn't about her. It was just about me. Honestly, that was really the thing that I noticed, was I didn't say it to make her feel better, I didn't say it to give her any peace. I came to that feeling before running into her. I didn't know if it would be true when I saw her, but I feel like so much of my energy had been such a waste. And worse than a waste, it had been twisted in the wrong direction. And it's too late for a lot of things. There are things I cannot take back and things that I have done that will forever be terrible, but that's not the point, I suppose. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=3h1m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h2m18s">It isn't. Whoever that boy was that created those things, that suffered such horrors that he felt they were justified? You have to forgive him, too. Because everything you've suffered and endured and created in that time has made you into the person you are now. And you have a brilliant mind. And any darkness that might cloud your vision on occasion, the fact that you found it within yourself to forgive her means that it will never overtake you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=qn8tLbXWAtc&t=3h2m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
