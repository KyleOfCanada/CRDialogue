<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone! And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">Slight delay there due to tech issues but we're back online and all is well. Tick issues are a problem-- It's a thing, I know. We're going to jump in here shortly. We have a guest who'll be joining us partway into the story. Before we get to that, let's go ahead and get to our announcements and get them out of the way because we're a little behind. We'll try and rush through. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">First and foremost, tonight our sponsor and has been our sponsor from the beginning and onward into the campaign, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There's also stickers and keychains and t-shirts-- lots of t-shirts you should check them out-- and notebooks and awesome pencils. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=0h4m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m1s">Speaking of the comic book: Issue five will be released on digital platforms of that very comic March 7th. Those that want to keep up and get to the next chapter of the six issue arc, issue five comes out March 7th so keep an eye out for that and we'll have announcements as that comes. You can look for a sneak peek at the artwork at geekandsundry.com. Once again, our campaign is pushing our fantastic friends at 826LA. They're an amazing charity group that takes underprivileged kids or children and young teens who don't have the opportunity to get in depth and learn about creative writing and give them a safe space for them. They do wonderful work. Check it out if you have the opportunity. See if you can give either financially or with your time and you can volunteer to be part of the program. It's really great. Other than that, appearances are as they've been and I think-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=0h6m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h9m3s">Welcome back. Last we left off: The group of adventures in seeking a warband of gnolls which had attacked the city of Alfield they were passing through on their way to Zadash. Began to track them as to where they had retrieved a number of bodies, both dead and living of the civilians of the town and taken them with them. You eventually track them to an abandoned mine a number of miles away from the city to the northeast. You entered, narrowly missed a trap or two, managed to recover a couple of interesting items, delved off to the left side during the first divide of pathways, and came upon some sort of small ritual with a number of gnolls and some humanoid figure wearing bits of gnoll as an armor or cloak. Doing a ritual-- after he had left along with the previously armored gnoll that you had battled during the incursion at Alfield. You tore into a number of hyenas and gnolls that remained within the chamber and upon defeating them, took a moment to take a breath, get your bearings before hearing a muffled boom in the distance, some sort a low vocalization, some cackling, and eventually the scream of a woman saying, "No, my baby!" You began to run and give chase. That is where we're picking up this week. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=0h9m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m3s">Grabbing your weapons and keeping your mettle about you, you charge further down the tunnel. The shaft curves to the right in a wide spiral about a few dozen-- there we go. What was that? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=0h9m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Two thick natural pillars of rock currently stand as load bearing portions of the chamber breaking the open space while a crumpled section of the floor drops into a pit below. Two closed doors, to the left of where you're looking into it, are guarded by a skeletal gnoll and two standard gnoll warriors, one of which has apparently pulled a small child from one of the doors. The sound of muffled cries coming from beyond the closed door. Four other gnolls rush from within the chamber into the right tunnel exiting on the opposite side.

Then, distracted from the child at the moment, both peeking over, the undead gnoll stands there glancing about, seeming unaffected by the current scenario.

<dd id="l1h7m42s">Okay. You guys carefully make your way back up through, trying not to drag the bodies over heavy bumps or rocks, eventually making your way out of the main entrance way. You notice a trap that you had deftly avoided multiple times getting people in and out, of a large tree trunk that had been suspended in the roof to swing down when triggered, had been triggered and is now hanging there. Apparently somebody made an unfortunate mistake making their way through. You all eventually find your way out into the daylight once more. The woman, who's now introduced herself as Herma, and the older half-elf man, Petrov, all step out into the light, blinking, bleary in the sudden influx of light. As soon as you make it into the open sky, you can see this breath of relief wash over both of them, and the young boy is now starting to come to consciousness again. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=1h7m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h9m24s">The door opens and there you can see emerging four survivors, also from Alfield that, with bright eyes, welcome the arrival of this strange traveler, as well as the three other survivors you've brought in. As some of them begin to reunite with people that are familiar to them, people who live in Alfield and know each other, they begin to hold each other and take a moment to relish in this renewed moment of life. Then they begin to pour over the bodies that have been recovered, and they begin to identify them to each other, and then sadness takes over. Then once those waves have passed, individuals begin to go up and thank you, and take your hand, and a few of them are like, "Anything I can give you, please, just let me know. Thank you so much." It's a lot, to have at once, and for many of you an experience that is different and new. Take it as you will, however you wish to, but you also know time is of the essence, and not too much time can be spent on this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=1h9m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Ahead, you see a set of rough stairs that rise for about five or six feet, leading to the remainder of the tunnel, and then curving to the left suddenly out of sight, slightly along this elevation. Right there, you have your bird (hovering hum), and right as the stairs ascend and turn immediately, there is the outer corner of a gnoll stands there waiting, keeping watch. (gnoll murmurs) Do you want to send your bird in further to check out the rest of the room or pull it back? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=1h14m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It has its large two-handed glaive in its hand, its shield slung over one shoulder, the bow over the other, and seeing this for the first time, you see this larger, muscular, more dark-furred gnoll that looks like the leader of this cluster, this pack. The armor it has is chunks of chainmail and hide armor that are patched together where a number of long, thin spines, like heavy, bone-like spikes have been woven into it like a decoration to make it look extremely intimidating. Right as it grins and gets its glaive ready, it gets blasted with three beams of burning arcane energy as they hit and impact you watch as the flames curl up and it has to pat it out with its giant hand. (snarling) It took the hit like a champ, and it seems like it's hurt, but it's still doing pretty well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=2h2m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You do manage through a collection of shinies in the pack leader's pockets and manage to find roughly 13 gold pieces, three silver and no copper. It only wants things that are shiny. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=2h39m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h46m13s">You undo the pouch and now have it in your possession. As you're focusing through the Duchess's vision, beyond the broken doorway the tunnel grows rougher as you sense that the deeper shafts of the mines are coming to an end fairly soon. The scent the Duchess is picking up is strong, that weird musky smell. After about 100 feet of it snaking a little bit forward, through ten, 15 foot wide tunnels, suddenly the tunnel opens, into a large, rocky alcove formation, stalactites from the ceiling, and some elements of broken digging equipment around the corners of this chamber. The uneven ceilings stand about 15 to 20 feet tall within in places, and are scarred with pick marks from various attempts to meet the end of the mine, which apparently were not enough to keep the mine in business. A rough slope descends from the immediate entrance to this tunnel, hits the wall before it, rises a few feet past that to a smaller platform that meets the opposite side of the wall, about 70 or 80 feet to the other side. The chamber's about 80-foot from where you enter to the opposite end. Near the base of the raised rock you see two humanoid figures, sitting against each other, bound tightly in ropes and above the platform on top, you see a figure you haven't seen yet. Human-like, but seems to have large chunks of gnoll flesh strapped to their body, like they used a disembodied gnoll arm as a glove, a gnoll head with the jaw removed and hollowed out used as a hood. There is this individual carrying baubles and chains of some symbols across their neck and they're spattered with blood. They're standing at the top, currently holding a third humanoid figure who is bound in ropes, and dragging them up the stairs to this platform on the opposite end. Next to this gnoll-wearing priestly-like figure, you see the figure in their arm is a guard, one of the Crownsguard of Alfield. You don't recognize him at a glance, but you can see they are currently still living, bloodied and are being dragged up to the top of this platform. You can see right at the top of this raised section a monstrous mound of broken wood, rope, burlap and scrap from nearby within the mine that has been amassed into this large pile. At that moment a majority of the mound begins to move and shift, as two large, brown red, leathery wings unfurl from the mound. Where a fur-covered body steps out. Is the Duchess going to stay and continue to watch? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=2h46m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h49m34s">This creature stands up from within this pile, you can now see this large, lion-like body and torso the size of a rhinoceros, massive and muscled, with giant clawed paws. Around the neck you see this thick, red, fiery mane of hair and a humanoid female face, dark and tanned, with this large, curled grin. The mouth that opens and hangs with rows of sharp teeth, but weirdly humanoid in appearance. It turns its head towards this priestly figure, who thrusts the guard to the front and says "Come, gifted mother. Feed and may you grow strong. Your strength is a boon from Yeenoghu, and one that will bring us much more meat in the time to come," and kicks the guard forward. This large beast turns, and inspects the frightened, shaking, and sobbing guard. "Your god meats hold me to nothing, but your offer pleases me and my child." As the beast stands up further in this pile of rough, found pieces of wood and twine, a small infant of its same species seems to be wound up and begins to mewl in its place. It's pawing at the air, its eyes not even freshly opened. This creature steps forward and bites into the Crownsguard and lifts it up as he begins to scream. The rest of you hear the echoing screaming in the distance of the Crownsguard. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=2h49m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h4m16s">You've heard rumors of such things being flung as a weapon and regrown quickly and begin to suddenly remember the spines that were affixed to the armor of the gnoll leader and the glaive. You rush in and have this moment of remembrance as you begin to curl forward, stealthing around the side as the ball bearing (ting ting ting). Both the priest and the manticore whip over in that direction. The priest pulls a glove on its hand that's a dull red color that begins to sparkle and glow at the tips of the fingers, and tightens it on its hand and begins to step down the stairs a bit in the direction of that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=3h4m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As the writhing stops, and she begins to stand up, looking down, looks back at the corpse of the child now laid still. Looks back at you with a look of pity and acceptance before (explosion). There is a burst of gore out of the chest, and the creature just falls to the ground, motionless. The wings flopping onto the ground, still. And silence takes the chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=3h57m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The remainder of the survivors greet you upon you letting them know you've returned, and you watch two more reunions occur as the two individuals you had saved from the belly of the manticore find the rest of their family within the survivors. You gather the rest of the bodies, and whoever needs the travel, and begin to load up the cart you brought with you, as well as the manticore head, unless you want to carry that back to town yourself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=4h5m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Within a short time, the crownsguard seemed to have brought Bryce back for you. Bryce, which you have not met yet, is currently the Watchmaster of the town. You see a genderfluid half-elf with blonde shoulder-length hair and armor. They seem to be recovering from the wound they sustained the night before and as you approach they immediately come up to you with a bit of a jog and say, "My gods, "you've certainly come through on my-- what is that?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAyT10WP-cY&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Given that still, a hero's night is to be prepared and people begin to prepare food. For a brief moment past the darkness, you can hear music begin to build as people begin to bring chairs and tables out to the center of the town square, the intersection of where Alfield's simple backwoods lifestyle seems to still understand what celebration is in the face of victory. As what better case is there to be but to celebrate those who stood up to such evils? As you all think over what you've done, this ragtag group of wandering know-nothings that have managed to come together and do a good thing.
