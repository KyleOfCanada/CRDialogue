<dd id="l0h0m0s">Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. First off, for those of you that are watching the awesome art sizzle, we are excited, We finally got the opportunity to get our fantastic fan song, 'Welcome to Wildemount', by Colm McGuinness, one of the Critter community and a very talented musician who made that piece. We've been trying to find a way to incorporate it since he put it up, so we're excited to have that as a lead-in of hype for the week, so thank you so much, Colm, for being amazing. You should check out his stuff. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m56s">This week, guys, D&amp;D Beyond is offering up another discount code for 24-- no, I read that wrong! 25% off any single purchase in the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace. Use code "InvisibleWand," not case-sensitive, at check-out to receive the discount. I've done a lot of things to promote D&amp;D Beyond and all of our sponsors. I've done poetry. I've done opera. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h0m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m56s">I've sung songs. But there's one art form that I haven't explored... and that's dance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h0m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m0s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m0s">He needs an outlet. It's good. It's healthy for him. Our second sponsor tonight is the upcoming game-- maybe you played the franchise before, but we have the Far Cry 5 game, coming up soon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h3m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m0s">Liam, if you want to talk about that a little further. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h3m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m15s">Oh man, Vax'ildan Vessar here from the afterlife. You know, most of the time, I sit here in a big black room wondering where the fuck I am or what's going to happen next. Probably nothing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h3m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m15s">But once in a while, the Raven Queen hands me a sheet of paper to help promote projects, and this week it is Far Cry 5. (clears throat) I got this four minutes ago. Far Cry 5 is available on March 27th on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Go to farcry.com-- we don't have any computers here-- to learn more and pick up a copy. The latest installment of Far Cry is set in fictional Hope County, Montana, where a fanatical doomsday cult known as the Project at Eden's Gate has taken control. You are the hero of the story in a thrilling world that hits back with every punch and where the places you discover and the locals you ally with will shape your story in ways you'll never see coming. Also, in celebration of the upcoming release, Nerdist's Dan Casey, Kyle Hill, and Geek &amp; Sundry's own Erika Ishii are filming a special Far Cry 5 training video where they took on challenges players will face in-game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h3m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h11m10s">It's all good. So, last we left off, the Mighty Nein have been making their rounds in the city of Zadash, seeking opportunities, information, getting their bearings amongst the various townsfolk, streets, and what goings-on there are. Getting updates from town criers wandering through the roads, speaking with individuals, going into bathhouses where you met up with your fantastic long-lost barbarian. Yasha coming in to join alongside you guys in your exploits. You managed to converse with a meeting, or at least Beau and Fjord met with a meeting of unhappy denizens of the Empire discussing their frustrations beneath the Leaky Tap, and had crossed some information with them. You had gone and made some purchases. You had sold off a few of the things you had acquired in your journeys northward along the Amber Road. You had decided to, looking for work, go to the King's Hall, where they had a task board there and had taken one of the contracts that had been posted. You would be paid to seek the sewers beneath the city, near the outskirts of the Tri-Spire area of the town, for something that had been lurking within those tunnels below. A couple of guards had not returned; one had gone there and fled. You were promised a sum of money, should you be able to exterminate whatever this entity is and bring back proof of its demise. You jauntily accepted this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h11m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m10s">Before this happened, as a part of a journey towards this Tri-Spire, both Caleb and Jester made their way there, Caleb unsuccessfully entering a nicer district of the city that did not seem to believe or respect his presentation. Jester did so. She got a room at one of the hoity-toity inns in the district and was led to some mild disappointments. Where we left off, the two of you had reconvened and begun making your way back to meet up with the rest of your friends at the Leaky Tap tavern. Probably at a brief distance from each other as Caleb has huffed off, in a bit of frustration. Eventually, Caleb, you make your way to the familiar outside of the Leaky Tap. You enter, the fresh mud now a little bit less fresh and dried against your face, into the interior. At this point, it's mid-afternoon, there's maybe about, let's say, nine patrons in there, and a number of your friends who have been waiting for the two of you to return that are all sitting around a table and discussing amongst themselves. The rest of you guys look across and watch Caleb enter, and then a few moments after, Jester enters as well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h11m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h38m6s">Yasha, as you climb down, immediately it drops, and your foot finds a rung. There's a metallic bar that acts as a ladder. As you begin to lower yourself down, you can look to your left and right, and what little bit of daylight is coming through helps fill out some of the interior. You can see what looks to be maybe 15 or so feet across, from side to side, 15 to 20 feet from this wall to the other, slick stones, a slight curvature that leads into a base where there is a small ditch or a basin where old liquid is trickling through. There is a mild decline heading away from the direction you are and a mild incline heading in the direction of the Tri-Spires. The smell is not pleasant, but you're a tough chick, it's never been an issue. So you get yourself down, and it's no more than ten feet to climb to the base of this at the moment. You see from this spot where you've climbed down, the ceiling drops low to about ten or so feet. You're probably about 15 or 20 feet below the surface now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h38m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Once again, the smell is stagnant, a combination of waste product and whatever else has rotted and congealed down there. That smell of bacteria-filled liquid and water. Continuing upward, it curves a little bit to the right and out of sight with a faint bit of torchlight that bounces off the slick wall. There is a weird humid warmness to the air down here. It's not extremely pleasant. You don't see anything else in here other than what look to be clusters of waste combined with sticks and whatever else has washed down here through previous storms and has begun to build up blockages here and there, maybe a foot, two feet across. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h40m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h49m46s">You guys continue back to where you were and traverse instead upwards. You guys had paid a little bit of attention when you were traveling towards the Tri-Spire, but the entire city is not level. There are grades to it. It was built over hilly terrain, as most of this valley itself has all sorts of varying heights of hills and clusters of hills. The Tri-Spire is up on a raised hill within the city's construct, so as you ascend in the direction of the Tri-Spire, you get the sense that you're not ascending too terribly much, but you're now just about underneath where the wall was. As it curves around a bit, you look ahead as Yasha's holding out her torch, and you can see a T-intersection of the sewer where it continues on straight, or heads to the right, or to the left. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=0h49m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you pull it back a few more inches, you watch as a rat head, lolls out, a tongue falling out the side.

You see a bracer that once belonged to a crownsguard. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=1h31m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

We'll see you guys back here in a few minutes. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=1h46m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You remember it coming into port, you were paid to take care of it, offload things, back on-- The name itself was derived by a wooden carving at the front bow of the ship that was of a mermaid with her arms extended that was gifting a human heart that was painted with this vibrant pink color that was its signifying visual. Yeah. Other than that, nothing particular about it, just that you were like, "Oh yes, I know that ship." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0rx28wgA4E&t=3h1m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
