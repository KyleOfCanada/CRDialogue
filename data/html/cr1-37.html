<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, the show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">We're happy to be back. We all had an awesome break; some good times away from the chaos of the city for some of us. And we're happy to get this ball rolling again. So we've missed you guys. In case you can't tell right now, we have some cool upgrades to the set, actually, if you want to have a look around real fast. The hardworking folks here at Geek and Sundry were awesome enough to go ahead and build this awesome set, and we're happy enough to have a guest here this evening, as Ashley Johnson is able to hang with us tonight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m39s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m39s">Hello! I like you! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h0m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m44s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m44s">Oh man, you know, I just flew in. Oh no, we're running out of space. Grog! Hi, guys. Wow, this looks amazing! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m59s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m59s">Yeah, the set upgrades are awesome. This is a tribute to the awesome crew that put all this together over the break, so you guys did an awesome job. Give a big shout-out to the Geek and Sundry crew. Yeah, and so for those who saw earlier tweets, we're pushing off Critmas to probably next week because we're all returning from break, we're all getting back into the swing of things, and we're still getting our bearings here. So we're doing that next week. But nevertheless, let's go ahead and start off with some of our quick announcements as we wait for the illustrious Sam Riegel to find his way here. There was a clamoring from the fanbase to extend the sale of the Critmas sweaters. Orders kept coming in, so we've extended it up to this point. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h0m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m19s">So yeah, Wyrmwood Gaming, CritRole for free shipping. That's awesome. Thank you, guys, again for providing that for our awesome fanbase. Also, I've just finally put up my final-- outside of, barring some horrible exploit that shows up months from now-- my final update to the Blood Hunter class as of ten minutes ago. You can go to my twitter. I think the link on the Geek and Sundry page isn't working, it still goes to the old PDF, but I had the link to the new PDF on my twitter, will be put up there shortly. A bunch of updates and with a link to the page that has all the patch notes, if you will. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h3m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m7s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m9s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m9s">And new art from our fantastic artist Joma who has done our poster and stuff; he did an incredible job. He named the character Elias and I think Elias the Blood Hunter is my new spirit animal. So thank you, Joma, for that, you're amazing, and go check it out and see. If you're playing a Blood Hunter, it's got some cool updates and I think some things you'll like. Also, our artist Kit Buss put up today her first peek of our new character art designs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h4m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m51s">I don't know when this became season two, but apparently, it's season two now. So. Season two. (laughs) That's cool. So go check out Kit's art and you get to see the evolution of the Vox Machina outfits and designs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h4m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m14s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m14s">Yeah. And don't think this invalidates the previous designs, either. This is just one of their various facets. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h5m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m29s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m29s">I wanted to put a thank-you out there to the amazing community of Critters that came together to do that Christmas art bomb. For those who haven't seen it yet, Liam here collaborated with a lot of you guys to put together an amazing gallery of Christmas, holiday-themed Critical Role art, and it's brilliant. If you haven't seen the gallery yet, I highly recommend it. You can find it on the website. You are a rogue, sir. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h5m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m53s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h6m12s">The last bit of my announcements for the evening, I wanted to put another thank-you out to the amazing Critter community. Thanks to you guys, even after Extra Life and everything that went on towards the end of the year, we were still able to donate an additional $5,000 to 826LA over the Christmas break. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h6m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m12s">(cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h6m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m30s">They're looking forward to continue working with us. We're looking forward to continue working with them, as well as the many other charities that we put up as part of our Guide to Critmas page. But they're very thankful and we're extremely thankful to have you guys being so active in giving back to the communities and helping these wonderful opportunities for younger kids to express their imaginations and creative writing skills. So thank you guys for being so awesome. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h6m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h7m12s">(rimshot) All righty, so. While we wait for Sam to arrive, let's go ahead and get into the game-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h7m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m25s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m25s">Oh my gosh, it's so pretty! The panels behind us. I was just admiring-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h7m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m31s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m31s">I still haven't seen how the layout looks. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h7m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m31s">I'm really excited for it. Also, for the guys who didn't notice, we've updated some of the models and we have colors and a new camera setup. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h7m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m31s">Hopefully we're going to be testing it out in the weeks to come for camera angles and stuff. Things might shift as it happens, but the color scheme on each of the characters' bases corresponds to their portrait color, so it should be easier to distinguish who is who on the battle mat going forward, so hopefully that'll be helpful. All right! Let's get into the thick of it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h7m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m31s">So last we left off, Vox Machina had finished an extensive, dangerous, tension-filled adventure to the city of Whitestone, the historical landscape that Percival had grown up in, to take down the Briarwoods, two husband-and-wife team who had been responsible for ruling it with an iron fist for five years, doing a series of atrocities and seemingly preparing a ziggurat, or an ancient temple, beneath the city for some unspoken deity that the party then discovered to be an individual referred to as Vecna. They defeated the Briarwoods, managed to help the rebellion of the people of Whitestone retake their town, and helped them set up, prepare, and have their first Winter's Crest festival in five years, since they were taken by the Briarwoods. There was much game-playing and eating contests and polymorphed bears and very fun adventures and exchange of gifts and some fun moments and the party, as we return now, the festival over, a few days past, begin to put their affairs in order to return back to Emon in what their next order of business is. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h7m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m31s">So picking up from there, it's been a few days since the Winter's Crest festival has finished, and most of the decorations, as quickly put together as they were given the circumstances, still loosely hang around the city as a reminder of the first real beacon of positivity in this city's history in a while.

You guys make your way into Emon, and the first thing you notice is, as it was recently Winter's Crest, a lot of the decorations are still up.

<dd id="l0h54m2s">It is a busy day, being midweek and about noon-time, so it's also nice to be back home where you can hear the classic sound of hoofs clopping on the cobblestone, the shouting of different individuals across the thoroughfare, and you make your way towards the center of the Cloudtop District. As you guys approach the main gate, the guards immediately step in front and as you two approach, "Halt, there! Have you business here in the Cloudtop?" And he looks over at you and goes, "You're Vox Machina.

You guys step back into the familiar area, the streets here much cleaner, the cobblestone much fresher-- this is where the more upper-class and elite of Emon stay, live, and keep most of their business. You make your way through with the two guards flanking you guys, and you can see four more coming down from nearby parts of the wall, and flank you guys from the back to make sure that you're encased and taken care of. As you walk through the streets, what turned out to be an arrival is almost a procession, as individuals are now coming out and seeing this group of you guys walking through the street and peek out. Some of the local nobles and such, some seem to recognize you and go "Oh!" and dart back in. There was a woman you spoke to a couple years ago, it was an older, spinster-type woman who was planning a wedding for her daughter. She waves for a second and goes to talk to you guys real fast, and then one of the guards raises a pike towards her and goes "Mmm." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h55m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

He said "if they show up to bring them in. They don't seem to be aggressive at all. If they're now going to "do anything stupid we could just kill them here, so they know better than to do anything stupid." The other guard person goes: "You're right, but I've seen what they can do. Bring out whoever you "have on shift." And as they step away, "This way, please!" and you can see the guard that was with you splinters off from the rest of the party and as you guys walk down the hallway, a few moments later, about 20 guards begin to come out from the nearby hallways, and follow behind you.

As he steps up and sits in his chair, he notices you guys entering with the guards, and nods his head for a moment and looks off to the side, and approaching him to join him on top of the platform is Seeker Asum, who apparently has returned, with his shaven halfling head, with his tattoos on the side, and Arbiter Brom, the cleric of Ioun who oversaw part of your guys' initial trial here in the castle chambers-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=0h58m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h0m36s">This build of tension begins to fill the room before he goes: "First and foremost, I owe each and every one of you the deepest apologies. I've "only recently cleared my head of a cloud of poor judgment, one that apparently wasn't one of my own "making." And you can see, he looks genuinely distraught. There's bags under his eyes a little bit, like he hasn't been sleeping well, and you can see one of the servants go: "Shall we bring "Salda?" He says: "No, no, it's all right. When last we spoke, we had a trial, many things that "were brought to our attention. In the time of your absence, in hoping that you would find means of "absolving yourselves of these charges, Seeker Asum here traveled out about to Wildemount to do his "own bit of informatory gathering. He returned about a week ago, and just as I was attempting to "sort out this haze-- Asum, if you would please." And he rests his hands for a second, and Asum steps forward and puts his hood back and closes his hands before him. "First of all, a gracious "welcome to you, Vox Machina and friends. I did my digging in Wildemount, specifically Wynandir and "Port Damali, near the southwest coast of the Shearing Channel. Inquiries by myself and my "gatherers before me revealed that the Briarwoods, while once respected in that community, had been "accused of necromancy about six years before, a practice that had long been outlawed in "Wildemount. Their estate and all lands were to be seized by King Dwendal, but the Briarwoods were "officially killed when their homestead was burned by a mob." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=1h0m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h3m7s">"By a mob. All official documentation in Wildemount on the Briarwoods was set in this day, "and that we the end of their line. However, this information was kept from ever making its way "across the shore, as there isn't a lot of business between Wildemount and Emon. Upon doing more "digging, in Port Damali, months later, it seemed that individuals matching their appearance "appeared briefly within the Port, where they bought a ship and hired a crew. Now there was no "political knowledge in Wildemount, or any approval of a bridge being built, either. This announcement "from the Briarwoods, whom had previously been silent, came about the time that I'd sent two of "my gatherers to look around, and never returned. I theorized that this entire presentation to Emon, "and these political handshakes, were a means to avoid suspicion. I don't know what to, or to what "means, but the timing seemed a bit conspicuous to me. Those were my findings in Wildemount, and "based on our last discussion, it appears that Lord Briarwood seemed to contain some semblance of "mind-affecting prowess. I myself befell to it, as did our Sovereign here. Thankfully, it came to its "end recently." And you can see there's a nod and a deep sigh of guilt that emanates from Uriel. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=1h3m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h3m7s">"Anyway, that is the gist of my findings while you were off in Whitestone. Sovereign." And he steps back, and Uriel raises his head, leaning forward with his elbows on the edge of his knees, still sitting on his throne. "It's also been brought to my attention that the attack within my walls was "indeed instigated by the Briarwoods themselves, and that Sylas is vampiric in nature. This is the "influence that clouded me. This is twice now that I have found myself, in spite of all of my "protections and intents to defend this city, that I have fallen prey to the wills and whims of some "infernal intent. And that is not a way to breed respect or trust in one's leader. I have a lot to "think about.

She looks over at you and gives you a winky grin. To the right of her you see a rather rotund human male, with a bushy blond beard and raggedy hair who currently has a series of small percussion drums around him and just hitting around, and to the other side of the small gnome girl you see a half-elven, more mature woman, in the later years for a half-elven woman, hair tied into a very, very tight bun, and she is in the process of singing this wondrous tune that matches this improvisational feel of the band. Currently Kent is not paying attention and is on the far right side, but behind them all, towering over, just by stature, is Dr. Dranzel with his violin, and as you stumble forward he looks over and just gives you a smile and keeps playing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=2h11m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The whole room just rouses in cheers and clapping, you can now see coppers and silvers and a few gold are being thrown onto the floor in front of you, there's a small bucket at the base of the small stage platform and Dr. Dranzel then stands up, takes his hat off of the ground next to him, and bows, as the rest of the group bows before as well. You know the drill, you've done this for quite some time. Everyone cheers, a few more drinks, even though you bought rounds for everyone, other people are buying rounds and bringing it up.

It has been reconstructed and there at the bottom of the stairway is a thick wooden door, wrapped in iron bars or strips of iron to keep it nice and taut and strong, and you can immediately see five locks down the side of the door. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=1cbxJRfvBtI&t=3h3m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
