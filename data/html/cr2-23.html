<dd id="l0h0m6s">First, beginning with our fantastic sponsor of campaign two, up to this point and going forward for hopefully infinity, D&amp;D Beyond. Sam, if you want to take it away. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h0m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m7s">Mine is a dangerous cause, filled with scary monsters, vile beasts, devilish devils. All of them can be found in the various Monster Manuals at the D&amp;D Beyond Store-o. Aha! What is this?! It is a generic tablet device, displaying a handsome array of content and inventory to streamline your tabletop gameplay. Why, this can only be the infamous handiwork of D&amp;D Beyond. With my blade, I cut down on prep time, I slice my physical book collection in half, I slay the enemies of book management? For I am (click click click) Storro! And I will never stop fighting until our D&amp;D Beyond contract expires! And then I will stop fighting!

<dd id="l0h2m59s">Storro lives on in our hearts. Hopefully only in our hearts. A few other updates. One: we have the standard editions of Vox Machina Origins are still available at Geek &amp; Sundry and the Alpha online shops. The special editions are gone. So you can find details at critrole.com. Talks Machina is our after-show every Tuesday, and this episode's episode will be next Tuesday at 7:00 pm Pacific time, where a number of members of our cast will be talking with our fantastic Cabbage Master, Brian W. Foster, to discuss the events of tonight's evening's episode. We'll have giveaway prizes for Gif and Fanart of the Week. Make sure that you submit them to submit@talksmachina.com. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h2m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m59s">Currently only U.S and Canada, excluding Quebec, are eligible to enter and win because of dumb rules. Also a reminder that Twitch Prime allows you, if you have your Amazon Prime account, to attach with your Twitch account to subscribe to a channel for free on Twitch once a month. If you can, do so. It's free. And that is it, and that's all; short announcements tonight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h2m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m12s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m12s">Wait. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h4m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m14s">#</a> <strong>EVERYONE</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m14s">Wait. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h4m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m16s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m16s">Wait, there's one more. I have a thing. This is not an announcement. One of the artists in our community, Jason deBit, who's been with us since the very beginning-- old-school Critter, has made great art, he's made art on his son's sandwich bags for years, and he made a lot of Critical Role art, too. He contacted me a couple of weeks ago and said something's coming, be on the lookout for it. He gave me a vague idea of what it was and didn't prepare me for what I'm about to show you guys. It's cabbage. So this is another example of how unbelievable the people in our audience are. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h4m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m16s">So Jason had an idea in 2016 to take a sketchbook and mail it around to other artists in the community. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h4m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m16s">This book and this box, because it's covered in notes, I'll let you guys look later, but this book has been traveling the planet since 2016. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h4m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m16s">Instantly started crying looking at this book. The rules, "When you finish with this book, email Jason, yadda yadda, if you use a medium that bleeds-- "Decorate it, send it on to the next person." It's been traveling. The very first one, I'll find some-- Kat Winslade has done art for ages. I can't. I just can't. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h4m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m31s">Lloyd. I'm not going to do everyone justice, and I'm going to take pictures of this. Every single picture in here. I opened this up for the first time an hour before the show and was openly weeping, like Liam O'Brien is wont to do. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h5m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m31s">Charlotte. There's one more that I want to find that I really like. That one's really good too. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h5m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m31s">I'll take pictures of all of them, but I can't tell you how much this meant to me and obviously to all them seeing it for the first time. Thank you. We have the best audience on planet Earth, bar none. Legitimately, thank you. Really, really, thank you. I'm looking at the wrong camera. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h5m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m35s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m35s">Thank you guys so much, oh my god. No, we're good. And on that note, let's bring us into tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h6m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h8m19s">Welcome back, everyone. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein had been traversing northward towards the Labenda Swamp, to make good on the first of two jobs they had accepted from The Gentleman back in Zadash. Upon traveling northward, you made a young feathered friend by the name of Kiri, who's been under your protection since. You briefly met Cali, who is a dragon-blooded sorcerer who joined you for a length of the journey. You managed to discover where the seemingly cut-off and abandoned safe house was. Beneath it, discovered what had been responsible for it going silent, by an underground tunnel network run by swamp merrow. You engaged with them, found a strange altar room where they had amassed everything they had stolen from the safe house, slaughtered the present shallow priest and his protectors, took what was necessary and what was of interest from that pile, including an interesting orb, made your way back out, closed the pathway the merrow had to the safe house, thus establishing its true safety once more, and completing the job of which you were tasked. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h8m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m19s">There, you spent an evening resting, and began heading back out to return from the northern center of Labenda Swamp towards the town of Berleben, and to where the next leg of your journey takes you. Mighty Nein, as you begin heading southward into the daytime of the thick, heavy swamp, what would you like to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=0h8m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h33m45s">You head to the Midway Docks. Following the outskirts of the Drydocks, which are a number of these wooden docks that head out into various edges of the swamp, where there are small boats that are currently roped off and being watched by the crownsguard that come across with torches, make sure that nothing gets stolen or anyone is doing anything untoward over in the area. Asking around, you eventually find your way to a relatively simple-looking building. Single story, but it stretches quite a bit and you can see a number of windows that are faintly glowing with candlelight. On the inside, it does appear to be a simple inn, with a small bar in the far corner. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=1h33m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h51m1s">There's no religious symbology here. In thinking through, there's nothing that gives you the essence that there's any sort of belief system locked into this that you're aware of. Looking at it, one: it immediately reminds you of whatever it is he jammed into his stomach, and two: the image of it, and the sea-based theme of these experiences that Fjord has been having, leads you to believe that this is something very old, and something that resides probably beyond land and possibly beyond the sea.

You can begin to see the edge of the Silberquel Ridge, the mountain range that, when you were approaching the Labenda Swamp, began to rise and kind of loomed over the swamp, and then began to slowly get more distant. As you traveled southward the crossroads begins to come further into view again. The mountain range moving closer, more massive, kind of peeking over, this large-- it's very, very steep edges to the base of this mountain range. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=2h49m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h15m14s">Passing a few travelers heading southward, crossing your way, until eventually, the Silberquel Ridge grows more and more prominent in your line of sight. Following the path, the fields that surround the north road begin to give way to tall grass and trade for scrub land and rocks, the once-vanishing shape of the Silberquel Ridge mountains growing bigger and bigger, the numerous columns of mingling black-and-white smoke you can now see spill from the eastern side of the mountain, diffusing as they rise. As you travel even closer, you can make out the two-tiered layout of a city built into the mountain. One large region encircles the very base of the mountain, ahundred or more dark workshops and towers, billowing smoke from chimneys and stacks visible. A number of large constructions dot the open spaces between these towers, some oversized cannons or others like mobile siege towers. One resembles a wheeled, multi-tiered cart with numerous, wicked-looking bolt-throwers attached. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=3h15m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h15m14s">As you begin to head in this direction, you can also see that this lower area, this industrial field of various engines of warfare that are in the process of being constructed, some in their skeletal phase of being built. To the base of the mountain above that, you can see two winding switchback roads as well as one very steep staircase that ascends to a second level, about a hundred or more feet above the first. Here you see a massive outcropping of leveled rock that holds the other half of the city. There along the ridge of the mountain shelf lies hundreds of buildings and arches, occasionally dappled with an autumn-colored tree. Behind this city mass, you see a shimmering waterfall that cascades from out of the center of the mountain, about 1000 feet up, that glimmers like silver-white light and the little bit of sun that's coming through the clouds. You've reached the outskirts of Hupperdook. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=3h15m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You do see from this perspective, as you're heading down to the base of the mountain, you're at the top of the hill, and this last leg as you start pushing in towards Hupperdook, at the base of where the waterfall is hitting, behind that row, you can see what look to be numerous towers, thin and tall, like these weird needles of buildings that kind of cluster around the base of the waterfall.

You could see some of these war machines that are being developed and designed here, mid-construction. You get the sense that with the call of war, they're probably put into high gear in developing whatever siege weapons they can possibly muster in the short time frame.

You also see siege towers, 30 feet tall, wheeled, with a number of ladders and platforms inside that are used to clamor up against fortresses. You see one that looks almost like a giant battering ram that is in the process of being constructed. The interior metal rod is currently resting on the ground next to it and they're building an outer frame. Looking past, on the far end-- on the northern end, you can see a huge cannon, maybe about 15 feet across and about three to four feet wide in the middle. That one is on a platform. The wheels are currently resting in the side and they're in the process of finishing the construction of the device.

<dd id="l3h27m44s">But as you approach, you hear this (thud). And looking up, you can see these chains, these big, heavy, dark chains that are shifting. And as it does, you can see this platform begin to lower from the city above, heading in your direction. In front of you, at the base of the mountain, you can see there are a few other individuals that are sitting there, waiting patiently. You can see this platform eventually comes down, seems to be one of many means to make your way to the second part of the city. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=xr1dOEL2EHQ&t=3h27m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It looks like the place is pretty much perpetually decorated for some sort of an event or a festival, but it's in disuse at the moment. It is empty. Everyone you see in the street, there's nobody taking a walk. Everyone is rushing from one place to another or shouting commands. There's a general air of busyness and intent in each person you see.
