<dd id="l0h0m0s">There's a big groove left behind her as she's being dragged through it. You get to the second trap that she marked, and you guys make your way around it. You make your way to where the road diverges, the one way to the castle, and the one to the acid pits. And Cassandra heads towards the acid pits. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WFbmY79Qdfc&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m44s">After about five minutes of following her, the path leads up and then crests, and there is a room that smells awful. It's similar to the acrid scent the room was filled with when the acid was pouring into the room. There's a whole series of other chemicals and inside, you can see there's a number of laboratory set-ups near you. You get the feeling this is probably where a lot of this particular acidic concoction that was fine-tuned for this stone of Whitestone was created, or at least, honed by Ripley. Without a beat, Cassandra walks up to the edge and just throws Delilah's body in. (plop, sizzle) Then it disappears beneath the surface as the hissing, bubbling noise takes over the silence of the room. She sits there and just watches it sink. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WFbmY79Qdfc&t=0h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h2m4s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m4s">Looking at it, you can see, Delilah's name is missing from the barrel entirely. Cassandra's name is still on the barrel, and so is Ripley's. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WFbmY79Qdfc&t=0h2m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m43s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m43s">17? Yeah, a brief look around you can see there are many different compounds, different strengths of acid, what a lot of the initial experimentation was. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WFbmY79Qdfc&t=0h3m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m51s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m55s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m55s">Okay. You take a moment and eventually manage to scar and dissolve enough of the exterior of that barrel until the name is no longer visible. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WFbmY79Qdfc&t=0h3m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m20s">So glad that your smoke monster is seemingly gone, Percy. That's wonderful news. The spinning orb of death, however, is still back there, so we should probably figure out what to do about that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WFbmY79Qdfc&t=0h4m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m43s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m43s">Well, I think perhaps we can talk to Keeper Yennen. Perhaps put together some priests to deal with that. Enlist the help of the entire town now that there's no longer a revolution to be fought. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WFbmY79Qdfc&t=0h4m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
