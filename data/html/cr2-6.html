<dd id="l0h5m19s">A little thing that is totally improvised. A couple of weeks ago, a Critter named Courtney-- forgive me if I'm getting that wrong-- She tweeted a picture of her with this scarf that she was making for Caleb, and she made the hashtag #ScarvesForCaleb and then people started talking about it. I retweeted because I thought it was awesome, and they came up with the idea to make scarves for Caleb-- But not for me-- to give to shelters: Homeless shelters, to veterans, to anyone who needs scarves or hats or mittens. I think it's a great idea, and you would make me happy. This is beautiful, I love it, thank you, but don't pile me up in scarves. Send them to people who need them. I just think it would be a nice thing to do. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=0h5m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h7m55s">Welcome back. You guys are getting sloppy. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=0h7m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m55s">Welcome back. Last we left off, our gathering of friends have been traversing northward along the Amber Road, with the distant destination of Zadash, one of the larger cities of the Dwendalian Empire, as your destination. Upon traveling, you passed a caravan, spent an evening amongst trees, where you found a wayward cluster of wandering buffalo...-like creatures. You continued northward for a second day, rushed on past sunset to rest in the city of Alfield, a small farming town that's along the way to Zadash. However, upon noticing that some of the buildings in the eastern side of town began to light up with flame, you began to approach rather rapidly, seeing members of the city, citizens fleeing and screaming, and there seemed to be some sort of attack. Upon going into the town, you realized that a number of these buildings are being set fire by an incursion of gnolls. You were immediately brought in by Watchmaster Bryce, who offered to pay you for each set of gnoll ears that were brought to them, and you jumped into the fray, managed to kill quite a few, many of them still left with their quarry, it seems, which happened to be quite a number of bodies and/or citizens still living, that were dragged off into the ashen and cloud-covered night. Upon returning, many of you bruised, beaten, and at one point in danger of worse, you were given an evening's rest at the Feed and Mead Tavern, and were told, if you were interested in pursuing future coin in helping with the current conflict nearing the city, to meet Bryce out by the Broad Barn. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=0h7m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m6s">That's a different place entirely. You guys all bundled up into a singular room above the floor of the Feed and Mead. Found yourselves exhausted, passed out, and got an evening's rest, so you've all gotten a long rest. You've healed up. You've recovered your abilities. As the uncomfortable warmth of the morning kicks in, with your small room and number of warm bodies encompassing a very tight and not very drafty space, the partially humid early hours draw you from consciousness. You all begin to stretch your sore muscles and decide what endeavors await you with the new day.

<dd id="l0h21m39s">As you emerge from the tavern-- and Caleb, you've already seen this-- you see that the fires have now been reduced to maybe a dozen wide plumes of gray-white smoke on the eastern side of the city. It rises from the ashes and charred wood remains and wood frames where some buildings used to be. It seemed much more dangerous and chaotic last evening, but looking at it now in the day, it's no more than maybe a dozen buildings or so that were affected. They were more centralized to cause the most chaos suddenly at that time of night. You get the sense as soon as you look around that the folks of the city are on edge, understandably so. You see the people are trying to pick up their lives and move on in the face of what recently occurred. The very air holds this tension as you look around you. People walk past you with sacks of grain and tools, their eyes wide, darting around for unseen danger and glancing past the two tieflings, immediately, instinctually step back a bit and make a wide berth. You watch children run from doorway to doorway, trying to stay out of the street as long as possible. It seems like it's trying to carry on, but it's going to be a process. Some folks are rummaging through the remains of the respective buildings. You glance over near where the central portion of your conflict last night took place, where the Candleglow Tavern is, and there you see, amongst the smoldering rubble of the inn, a single halfling man sifts through the wreckage, a crownsguard helping him lift heavier beams.

<dd id="l0h37m6s">You were told it was on the western edge of town, and since most of the city is built on two intersections of main road, you follow the core essential east to west path, and on the way out, where you first entered last night, even though you just ran past it, you can see there is indeed, right on the edge of town, almost like the town was built to fill the gap in between, a very large barn that looks to have hundreds and hundreds of feet of coiled rope on the outside. The front doors are wide open and you can see a number of folks are coming in and out, many of them with cleaning supplies, heavy pieces of cloth, buckets, whatever can be used to start getting rid of the remaining black splash and ashy covering of last night's destruction. You also notice, as you approach on the outside, there's a bit of commotion. You see a dozen or so crownsguard, and a handful of armed volunteers, that all appear to be in regular civvy farmer clothing, that are all gathered in a loose huddle, with Bryce among them. You hear a loud grating voice from within that huddle. As you approach from the outskirts, you see a middle-aged male gnome of ruddy complexion and slicked parted dark hair. He wears very clean maroon and gold robes, and that would lend an air of elegance, were he not hopping around and pointing fingers. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=0h37m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h37m6s">You see as he starts shouting between the crew, waving his hand around, "Without any warning, it was your job, Bryce! With Ruben cold dead, that "leaves no Lawmaster to preside, forcing me to take that position as well. I do not need that added "responsibility, but until we get a new Lawmaster instated from Rexxentrum, I have no choice." Bryce pipes up at this point, glancing over and seeing you guys' presence, "Starosta, I've sent a request "to both Zadash and Bladegarden for a supplementary force, but it may be weeks before any would "arrive. Can we send trained hands at my approval to retaliate?" At which point, the Starosta, which has now been identified, says, "We cannot spare any of our forces while the surviving guard are drawn so "thin. Out of the question! Maintain a vigilant perimeter and deflect any further incursions." Bryce nods slowly. "Can we at least have permission to hire mercenary strength to "retaliate, then? I feel not being proactive before the gnoll force can fully regroup would put us at a "severe disadvant--" At which point is cut off by the Starosta. "Yes, that's fine! Hire outside! I "don't want any more of my citizens' deaths on my record. Dismissed!" He immediately pushes through the crownsguard and storms off, which is hilarious to watch a gnome storm out of a group of people, and off with a huff is escorted by three crownsguard from behind, out of that space. The crowd begins to murmur and disperse, and go about their business. Bryce turns and smiles at all of you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=0h37m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h34m30s">As you guys stay low to the grass, pushing through with your hands carefully as you go, hearing the wind occasionally rise and fall with a distant (shh), the various waves of grass beating against itself, you come upon where the grass begins to fall off. You stay low as best you can before the grass itself comes to an end right on the outskirts of where the central area between these hills begins. There, as you poke your head through, you can see three carts that are scattered a bit amongst a mineshaft yard. The exterior of a mine. You can see large, wooden pan tables; some pickaxes that are leaning against the side, the remnants of some lanterns that have rusted. There are the three carts. The carts themselves are spattered with blood. You notice three creatures, similar to the gnolls that you saw the night before, but smaller and dog-like. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=1h34m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h34m30s">These are just basic hyenas that are gathered around and are licking the blood that's soaked into the wood. One of them ends up finding a piece of meat, or something that was hanging from one side, and tears it off. Another one comes over (whines) and bites onto it, and they begin tearing and fighting over it before one of them pushes the other over and it (yelps). It goes back and begins licking the blood off the side of the wood. These three hyenas are just scavenging on the outskirt of these carts. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=1h34m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h47m51s">All right. As you pull it back, you do see the wooden support structure of the interior of a mine shaft. As soon as you pull it back and look inside, it looks like a barricade has been partially placed up on each side. You see piles of broken furniture, stools and chairs that are shattered and jammed into each other to form some sort of a barricade on each side. You can see dry-rotted pickaxe handles, and other pieces of general wooden beams used for construction that are all pushed up against the sides, with a small path, maybe about three feet wide, that you could walk through to enter. It looks pitch black on the inside. There is no light source outside of what little bit of daylight is coming through from the entrance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=1h47m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

This one does not snake, this one continues in a continual curve for another 40 or so feet before you're starting to get a little far from your friends.

It fits into the dice box that comes with it as well. We're giving away two of these during the break. To enter this while we're gone at the break you can go into the Twitch chat and enter, when you're prompted, the code word gnoll. That's G-N-O-L-L. Do not enter it more than once or you'll be disqualified, and we'll come back from the break with two winners to this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=2h19m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The more that you focus in, you can see this looks to be a humanoid figure that is wearing pieces of hollowed-out gnoll-like armor. A hood missing a jaw that's placed over the top of the head, sections of arms worn like a glove with the hand missing, sifted through. It seems that a lot of the body parts are discolored and rotting a bit, from what you can see from the candle light that's flickering across it. Long bonelike spines, similar to what adorned the armor of that pack lord that you battled in the middle of the city last night, are also affixed to the outsides and pierced through elements of the shoulders and head of this flesh gnoll hide that it's wearing. As it growls, mimicking the sounds of the gnolls that it seems to be residing along, the other gnolls around look, pacing from foot to foot impatiently (growls and grunts). Begins to speak louder and louder at this altar as it places a final wet stone on it. All the remaining gnolls begin to bark in unison together (bark and howl). <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=5DHEj9nY-wo&t=2h36m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You can see a similar grin across the center. It's all blood splattered from the hearts that were placed on there. As you wipe a little bit of it away, you can see stained into this loosely tanned human skin the same symbol of the jagged smile. The jagged teeth that form a grin that the various tanned banners that are stapled into the stone walls show and reveal. But no notes.
