<dd id="l0h0m0s">Welcome, everyone, to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, roll dice, and play Dungeons and Dragons. We are back after a week hiatus in which we were at San Diego Comic-Con! (cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m14s">We are recovering, some more than others, from Comic-Con. But we had a great time. Fantastic turnout. It was great to meet all those wonderful Critters that got out there, you guys were awesome. The panels were sufficiently ridiculous. And yeah, it was a good time had by all. If you weren't there, I know Geek and Sundry put up the panels, the videos from the panels up on the website, geekandsundry.com, so you can check them out there. Speaking of cool events, we're actually going to be at GenCon next week. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h0m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m46s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m46s">I know, it's crazy! I am at a series of panels all throughout the weekend, many of them voiceover-related. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h0m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m55s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m11s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m11s">It is exclusive to GenCon, the same way we did our exclusive for New York Comic-Con poster last year. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h1m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m20s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m35s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m35s">Yeah. I will say that the last poster was based heavily on the Underdark arc and the coming battle with K'Varn. This one has to do with a later arc in the story. So there's that coming up, we're excited about that, and then we have our Critical Role live show that Saturday at 8pm Eastern Time. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h1m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m53s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h2m4s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m4s">We'd love to see you guys. Partially because we don't get out to the middle eastern side of the US as often as we'd like, and this is our first time at GenCon, which has been my gaming mecca for so long. Should be a fun way to roll it in. So come check in the next chapter that'll continue after tonight's episode, at GenCon, and hope to see you there. We have our sponsor tonight for this episode of Critical Role, returning favorite in Backblaze, who previously popped in to say hello. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h2m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h2m36s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m36s">Backblaze is back, everybody. I've already composed a song about it. It goes like this: (singing) Everybody, yeah. Backup your data, yeah. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h2m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m36s">Upload your local files to an encrypted cloud-based backup storage system, yeah. Backblaze back, all right! (speaking) That was good! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h2m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m7s">Backblaze is unlimited cloud backup for Macs, PCs, for just $5 a month.

My stuff is continually uploading to the cloud and I always know it's there for when my hard drive crashes, they'll send you a new one in the mail-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h3m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m41s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m41s">And Critters get a fully-featured 15-day free trial at backblaze.com/criticalrole. So go check it out, keep that song in the back of your mind when you do. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h3m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m54s">And they also made a little commercial for us. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h3m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m25s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m25s">Indeed. All right then, that being the case, let us dive into the insanity of the Feywild in tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h5m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m25s">[dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h5m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m4s">Welcome back, everybody. So. Getting us into the story for this evening, the backstory of the current episode. Vox Machina, in attempting to find ways to topple and destroy the Chroma Conclave, have found their way around the world seeking items called the Vestiges of Divergence, artifacts of great power that should aid them in their attempt to take down Thordak the Cinder King, the red dragon who now sits lording over the central town of Emon at the center of Tal'Dorei. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h7m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m4s">Their recent journey has brought them into the Feywild, a pseudo-parallel plane of fey magic, chaos, and all sorts of goodness in between. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h7m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m4s">They've wandered through, met an old friend in Nala, the nymph of the lake. Discovered a fantastically artistically talented satyr by the name of Garmelie, and had a trip to the city of Syngorn, the elven city from Tal'Dorei which had phased into this realm for safety when the dragons of the Conclave attacked. After a fateful re-meeting with the parents of Vex and Vax, discussions were had, hats were attempted to be stolen by the leader of the city and successfully done so. The other half of agreements were pseudo-achieved. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h7m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h8m28s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m28s">Read your contract. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h8m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h8m30s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m30s">And they made their way northward through the ever-shifting grasses to the outskirts of the Moonbrush, a heavy, heavy, forested wood that will lead them to their destination after that, which is the Gilded Run, a series of rivers that wrap around their final destination, the Shademirk Bog, where apparently this Vestige exists. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h8m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m30s">So. Diving in where we were. The last time, you guys had managed to wander a few hours into the southern portion of the forest of the Moonbrush. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h8m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m30s">Coming through, you realize that, as opposed to the rest of the Feywild you've encountered so far, which exists in a perpetual dusk, there is an actual starry sky and moonlight poking through of a full moon at portions of the canopy of this forest. Cruising ever forward, you stumbled upon what looked like some sort of a cave or cavern with a series of small stone and wooden trinkets and gifts that were left outside, as well as carved bones and rotting fruits, and you came to realize that these were probably left for the spiritual entity that lived and existed within this cavern. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h8m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m30s">Upon some of these gifts being disturbed, the bear attacked, and Vex'ahlia summoned forth Trinket, her faithful companion bear. A battle took place, putting Trinket in a difficult position, but upon a brief discussion with this spirit bear, had proven himself a worthy entity, and was bestowed a boon, further solidifying the bond between Vex'ahlia and her faithful companion, Trinket. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h8m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m30s">And that was where we left off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h8m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m46s">No, the trees have relaxed, the canopy has reopened above the small clearing, and the rest of the party, you can now see Vex on her back on the ground, Trinket standing over her towards the cavern, and Keyleth pulled back, looking a bit shocked and confused. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h10m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You, Keyleth, do know that occasionally on the Material Plane there are entities, spiritual energies, that gather based on worshipping specific fey spirits and these creatures over time, these spiritual energies, begin to take the form that their worshipers give them. It takes a long time for this transition to happen, and essentially these guardian spirits, usually guarding some sort of a powerful fane, or a magical core or center, they become protector spirits of that region. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=0h13m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The fire shakes and dissipates, almost going out. Scanlan, you can see reach up and grab the sides of his head in pain. The guard and the wolf that were dancing do the same, except they both collapse immediately on the ground.

It's at that point you begin to hear (footfalls) what sounds like a series of heavy footfalls at a speed, and the sound of trees thrashed as various hanging vines and branches are snapped or passed at such a speed. There is a mass of black shadow that comes emerging from the brush, slamming into the side of one of the trees near you with a clattering (crash). You see it pressed up against the side before leaping off, rebounding, landing right beside you guys, separating your group, giving Scanlan, Vex, Trinket, and Garmelie pushed to one side and the rest of you to the other. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=1h17m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

A series of various jeweled necklaces adorn its throat, and you can see what appears to be a makeshift leather belt and armored leg piece that sit upon it. Rings glimmer around its fingers, and you can see a series of scars drawn across one side of its cheek that go down to its throat. It looks about at the rest of you, separated, glancing at each side.

You can see the bark of the nearby tree trunks being covered with various bits of ranger shrapnel as most of the pixies try and avoid, but most getting blasted with some semblance of impact. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=3h0m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h49m39s">You journey with them. They make a pretty quick pace. Even at your fastest, you resort to tracking them. They're moving with quite alacrity and they know this forest really well. As you guys begin to approach the outskirts of the little grove where the Wishers existed, you see a heavy battle has just begun to calm down. You see two additional wolf statues now stand amongst the area, but the abodes have been destroyed. You see that the tiger has grabbed a pixie and tears it in half. A couple others that have been darting off in the distance, trying to escape, three more of the wolves jump up into the trees, and you see them jumping from branch to branch before their lights-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QKaubU-lk04&t=3h49m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You are free to pass through this forest." As Lord Ukurat reaches down and grabs two of the stones, you can see as his fingers grab them, they're burning his palms, singeing. There's a bunch of energy pushing back on him as his fur is blown and there's a bright light emanating from the center of the circle. Wrestles them forth from the ground.
