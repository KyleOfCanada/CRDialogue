<dd id="l0h0m0s">Welcome, everybody, to Critical Role! Our Thursday night show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons and roll dice and all that fun stuff in between! So for all you new folks, welcome to our chaos. For all you old folks, thanks and welcome back. We have a number of announcements to get through. I'll try and cruise through them as fast as humanly possible. Pardon my phone as a reminder. Google docs are a delightful thing. Starting off, I wanted to direct all you Critters to our official Twitter, @CriticalRole, for official news and announcements. You're welcome to still tweet at us for individual cast fun but we do have our official source for all official announcements, times, and our appearances. That would be the one to pay attention to. Go to @CriticalRole, follow it and any important stuff that comes in the future will be available via that Twitter. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">Awesome. Next up this weekend we're all going to be at New York Comic Con, which is going to be awesome. We have a two hour block from noon to 2:00 PM Saturday, October 12th. Where is it at? What's the room? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m4s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m4s">It's a weird word, the Winga Stage? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h1m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m13s">It's not on the Google Doc. Curse you, Google doc! But Saturday from noon to 2:00 PM, and then on Sunday, for those who can't make the actual convention, we're having an off-site gathering of Critters at the wonderful and illustrious comic book store Forbidden Planet. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h1m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m13s">That will be from 2:30 to 4:30. Our time block shifted a little later in the day. 2:30 to 4:30, Forbidden Planet, we'll be there. We'll be signing autographs, meeting you guys, chatting it up, and we'll be debuting our brand new awesome poster here, exclusively for the New York Comic Con. Our Critical Role poster! We're super excited about it. This was wonderfully designed by one of our fellow Critters Joma Cueto. Joma did the art and Kim Davis did the actual layout and design. Both did an amazing job. We're going to have a bunch of these available. We'll be signing them for you guys, and we'll hope to see you there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h1m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h2m31s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m31s">The Wikia stage on Saturday, near hall 1A, the Wikia stage at noon to 2:00 PM. Come find us on Saturday, we're going to be there. Also, a ton of mail was recently received just after Critmas. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h2m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m31s">If your gifts weren't seen this last Critmas, they're probably in this batch. So next Critmas is probably going to be a long haul. It's going to be a doozy! But we're excited about that. That'll be the first Thursday of November, so look forward to that happening then. Next update. If you haven't been paying attention, we've been having occasional interviews once a week of our cast going up on Geek and Sundry's website. Today we had Travis's go up and if you haven't checked them out you should. It's a little step into our mindset, our crazy history and background of how this whole thing got started. Silly things ensue. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h2m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m31s">So go read them if you have the chance, if you haven't yet. Or wait until after the show. Also, as of today we now have in the Geek and Sundry store Critical Role key chains and necklaces. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h2m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m44s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m44s">Pretty rad. I'm really excited. They're metal and awesome. They're of our logo and if you feel like being as nerdy as we are and want to adorn your key chains with them, they are there available for your purchase. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h3m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m58s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m58s">They're custom order, so they make them when you order them. It takes a few weeks to get them once you order them, but it's worth it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h3m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m6s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m6s">They have to come all the way from Kraghammer. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h4m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m11s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m11s">Mithril's hard to sculpt properly. Takes a while. Couple of other things, LARP: the Series, one of the live action series here in Geek and Sundry. Season two just premiered today. It's a really cool series that both has moments of drama and comedy that plays into the whole world and lifestyle of the LARPing game systems and the people. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h4m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m11s">It's a really cool series. Check it out if that's your kind of bag. It's good stuff, really funny. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h4m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m11s">Next Monday starts a new show called TPK Monday Nights, where our illustrious Ivan, who hosts many wonderful things here, will be running for the rest of October a group of other individuals through the RPG Outbreak Undead, which is actually a really cool RPG that Ivan actually designed and was in the whole process for, so it's Monday nights, check that out the rest of October! To keep the Halloween theme, we will probably be getting dead repeatedly at the hands of Ivan, so look forward to that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h4m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m11s">This is the last week you can buy the #NoShaveTil10k shirts. We have people who are keeping it up. I had to shave for Vin Diesel, but the rest of the month is straight on this now, largely for my Halloween costume and for this wonderful event. 20% of all proceeds from those shirts goes to the Extra Life charity we've been supporting, it helps out good people. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h4m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m45s">We've already hit 9,100. Protocol95, you are the first winner of the night! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h5m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m51s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m51s">Protocol95, congratulations. You will be winning the first bundle. Every 100 subscribers there will be another giveaway within the chat room. You have to be active in the chat to be up for it. It includes a cast photo signed by the cast of Critical Role, possibly signed while he's wearing that awesome beard. And a wonderful piece of art from our main artist Kit Buss, also signed by the cast of Critical Role. So every 100 subscribers, that giveaway goes out in the chatroom. Be active and bring your friends on to subscribe so you can win one. Last thing I want to mention, this has been a question that's come up quite a bit, some people are definitely eager to hear the information, so I had the pleasure on Monday this week of designing and running a very quick game of Dungeons and Dragons for Vin Diesel. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h5m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m41s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m41s">Let's just cross that bucket list item off immediately. That was ridiculous. So it was a lot of fun. He was fantastic, super awesome, genuine, and was really excited-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h6m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m54s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m54s">It was literally bucket list! That was one of the things we discussed when this game started; it could lead to a game with Vin Diesel. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h6m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m0s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m0s">I bet if you go back and look at the Q and A session we had, someone asked our dream game crew-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h7m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m7s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m7s">Vin Diesel was one of our bucket list players. So we've already knocked one off on the show. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h7m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m24s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m24s">Next Thursday at the midpoint of next week's Critical Role, we are going to show a mostly complete video of that game. The full one will be released shortly thereafter, but next week, on Critical Role during the midpoint, we're going to show you the majority of that game session with him. Don't miss that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h7m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m59s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m59s">All of those answers at once. A majestic scent. It was delightful. We'll have interviews going up throughout the week, exclusively next week here on Thursday you'll be seeing most of that game here and then more stuff's coming out for the week thereafter. Really excited about that, and I custom-made a witchhunter class for him that I tailored for that level, and there's been such a wide response for everyone asking about the class that I've now spent a lot of my free time that I'm not preparing for this game now customizing a homebrew witchhunter class for all of you to partake in. So that'll be fun and probably coming out sometime next week. It'll probably be broken. You're welcome to homebrew my homebrew, I'm not perfect, but it should be fun and a cool guide for some people to give it a shot as a player class, so look forward to that. Liam, you got a couple things to announce? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h7m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h8m50s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m50s">Yeah, just two things. I wanted to thank every Critter who helped out with Joe Madureira's Kickstarter with Airship Syndicate's Kickstarter for Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They crushed it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h8m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m50s">They got to almost every rung of their ladder. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h8m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m50s">Maybe you guys could help them raise 100k tonight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h8m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m50s">But Joe told me that they saw a little bit of a bump every Thursday, and that our roleplaying power had some effect, so thank you guys, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h8m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h12m54s">So to get you guys caught up on what happened recently, the group, having heard that the Briarwoods, a couple who had taken power in the town of Whitestone far to the northeast, apparently responsible for the destruction of Percy's entire family and his escape into the wilds of Tal'Dorei, were going to be coming to Emon to bridge a political handshake with Sovereign Uriel and all of Tal'Dorei proper to build a bridge across the channel that separates this continent from Wildemount across the sea. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h12m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m54s">Upon hearing this, the party was planning to gather information, and in doing so Vax got himself caught by sneaking into their bedroom and was nearly killed in the process. The group managed to aid him, pull him out from the jaws of death, and the Briarwoods escaped through arcane means, leaving a shattered carriage, a mostly beaten driver of their carriage. Through the scuffle, a number of guards were hurt or killed, and the party, upon meeting an individual named Lilith, a tiefling, leading her back to the Keep, they were attacked, or seemingly attacked, by a series of bounty hunters that were after her. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h12m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m54s">There was some intense violence displayed against a few of them, and this all got back to the Council. The Council called Vox Machina to the central palace and began a trial to see if they were responsible for attacking guests of the Council, ruining what could've been a very lucrative union between the two towns and possibly murdering an old woman. They had their membership revoked, and during this sequence, apparently the charmed Seeker Asum was restored, seemingly to little effect. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h12m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m54s">The group then left, realizing that perhaps the moral ramifications of their actions are having a bigger impact due to their visibility and their heroic status in the kingdom at large. When they returned to the keep, they found two representatives of the northern farmers of Emon that required aid; their livestock had been stolen over the past few weeks and was putting them in dire straits when it came to the necessary amount of meat they had to raise. The group, trying to turn their morality on its head, decided to aid, waited out in the center of the cow pasture at night, masquerading, through illusionary magic, as cows themselves. The giant roc, a gargantuan bird, swooped down and grabbed Cow-leth, Keyleth, here. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h12m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m54s">Swept her away. The rest of the party, Tiberius enabled to fly through arcane means, and thus we had a squadron of evening cows chasing after the roc, which then got turned into a cow, to crash into a mountain. They chased it back to its perch up in the Cliffside Mountains to the northwest of Emon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h12m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h16m12s">After some rather roundabout and at some points on-the-edge-of-conflict conversation, they managed to convince him to instead take the bird and flee across the Ozmit Sea, to the northwest, towards Vasselheim, where it would be a much better landscape for the creature to thrive and grow. After that, the party is making their way back. Right around the beginning of daybreak, towards the keep. So that is where we left off.

<dd id="l0h17m5s">Darkness. Cold, lonely darkness. A flicker of light. It swells, bright, white, blinding, then flashes of your family, screaming. Julius, silenced by a bolt to the throat. Vesper, thrown from a tower wall. Your younger brothers' lifeless bodies tossed in a pile. The smell of death filling your cell. Your father Frederick, a blade jutting from his chest, slick with crimson. Your mother, Johanna, burned with irons, screaming. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h17m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you look around, you can see your leather gloves are still on, apron on, blackened soot spread across your face, and a series of things you were in mid-build on broken before you on your workshop table. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=0h17m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h0m37s">Nice! All righty, so you run up (hammer strikes) hammer down a third time, you can see its body being beaten around by the attack. And you see the whispering of its wind around its lower body is starting to slow, and it's looking like it's getting more sluggish, but it's definitely still intent on its job. That ends your turn, Grog. Vax, you're up. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=1h0m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h0m57s">All right, in a split second I'm watching Grog take the thing apart. I size up everybody in front of me in the distance and I think I can Assassin Creed my way through the crowd because I can go 60 feet normally, so 30 feet if it's crowded, and I'm going to use Grog's proximity to take this thing apart. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=1h0m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h1m15s">Okay. I will say you would normally get advantage. Because you're attacking it through the bars, melee, it disables it, so it's just a straight attack.

<dd id="l1h1m58s">All right. With that, the first blade comes through and you try and get it through the bars and it gets nothing. You pull back, take the other dagger and swing through it.

<dd id="l2h18m52s">Okay. Did you pay for it already? You paid up front. Okay. So you get the canteen, the explanation is: the enchantment of the actual water creation itself is separate than the holy enchantment that has been attached to it. The holy enchantment is not very powerful because it is an enchanted item. How it functions is the first burst per day that you use of the water does an additional 1d6 radiant damage. That's it. But any additional after that is just water. Basically, whatever water is immediately contained within it at the start of the day is considered blessed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h18m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h18m52s">Once that's expelled, all the rest that it creates-- because it's pulling it out of the elemental plane of water; that's how it's continuously projecting it.

<dd id="l2h50m15s">The forest to the front of the city. There's also the Alabaster Sierras themselves, which surround that peninsula that extends into the northern part of the continent.

<dd id="l2h51m51s">You guys head out from Westruun; it takes about a day's worth of travel. You stop in the Turst Fields. It's a small farming community. You ask around for a bit, most of the folks there say that they haven't had much trade or communication with Whitestone like they used to. They do still provide crops and such, but they don't allow anyone past into the actual forest. They trade at the boundary created by the forest. Still pay gold, but it seems to be more enclosed scenario, but very few folks there seem to question it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h51m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h51m51s">Business as usual is still left within Turst Fields. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h51m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h51m51s">Make your way northward to the bottom of the Alabaster Sierras, and as you begin heading up the outskirts of this mountain range, you do notice that the mountains are extremely high in altitude. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h51m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h51m51s">There's a perpetual climb at nearly a 40-degree angle as you continue upward further and further and further. The drop-off at the edge of the cliff is 1,000 to 2,000 feet at times, straight down into the ocean or rocks below. There are paths worn up here; it has been used as travel before. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h51m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h51m51s">Although you're uncertain as to how recently it may have been traversed. Occasionally, the wind picks up and you have to steel yourself, push yourself against the side. The path, thankfully, is maybe 15, 20, sometimes 30 feet in width. It's not too much where you're being forced against the edge, but it's enough to be aware of the danger of the circumstance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h51m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h51m51s">You guys are heading up, I'd say, about half a day's travel, it's about 2:00 in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h51m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h51m51s">Also, you can tell there are slight outcroppings a few hundred feet down to the bottom, a few bits of stone that jut out from the side. You can see small nests or bushes that have taken root on those side areas. The rock itself of this mountain range is unusually, unnaturally white. The actual rock that forms this entire region is almost a glowing quartz-like texture. There are parts that are almost translucent, there are parts that are very milky white. Number one, you can now understand as to partially why the area is called Whitestone, the town nearby, and you've heard mention from Percy in the past of the large quarries here that mine the stone for various uses and export it throughout all of Tal'Dorei. That's where a large portion of the town was built around that trade at the beginning of its construction. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h51m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h51m51s">Eventually, you come to a point where there is a falloff on the path, where the erosion or some sort of large impact of the side caused the path to fall into a scooped crevasse that is a smooth fall down the side. There is no way across other than a large sea salt air-rotted rope bridge that goes across about a hundred feet. You see it rocking (creaking) with the wind. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=2h51m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h0m48s">Yeah, that would be 12 seconds, which will be enough time. So as you're coasting over with Trinket, floating (bear sounds) you turn around and cast Telekinesis. Grog, all of a sudden, you're lifted up and held aloft. You look down over yourself, waving your hands instinctually. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=3h0m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h0m48s">Looking down, you can see a 600, 700 foot drop before the rock comes to a point which would probably splinter or crush anyone who fell into it, and then is pushed out to the ocean. So it's a little scary, but you start flailing about as you're being pulled across by Tiberius. Eventually, Trinket comes, lands on the other side safely. You guide Grog over, down onto his feet.

You take the next 15 minutes or so, finding what nearby pieces of brush you can and rocks that have been loosely around the area and you start setting up this pattern of them that closes off some of the entrance from the smooth opening that Keyleth had created. It takes a little ingenuity because it's just a rock opening, and there isn't a whole lot of brush and things around. But you feel you've managed to mask it to the point that to a distant eye it would be hard to see that there is an actual cavern there. At this point, the sun has set, night has come in, and you guys are sitting within this cavern hearing the distant sound of the ocean waves crashing against the bottom of these cliffside, coastal fjords. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=3h8m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h23m42s">24. You've heard of various lizard-like creatures that grow to large sizes. Usually those fall into the realm of dragons and such. The color blue, though, is uncommon, unless it were a blue dragon. However, the motion of this creature does not seem to necessarily be the territory of a blue dragon. It's hard to point exactly what this is, but you do know it's probably something in the serpentine-type magical realm. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2mB-aM2bIBk&t=3h23m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
