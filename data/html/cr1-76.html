<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. We have quite a quickly ramping episode tonight, but before we get to that, let's go ahead and talk about a few of our awesome announcements and sponsors. First up, tonight's episode is sponsored by our good friends, as always, at Loot Crate. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m23s">Sam, you have a few words on that? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h0m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m26s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m26s">Guys! I've got some talking points here. Go to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and enter promo code CriticalRole for ten percent off your subscription, or lootcrate.com/VivaThordak. Enter promo code "Sam reads these ahead of time. Just kidding, that doesn't exist, but that's what "happens when I don't read the notes ahead of time." That was very funny, crew! Very funny! The crew got me! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h0m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m54s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m4s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m4s">That's amazing! They got me! Well, that's fine. Well, I had prepared something, should I do it anyway? All right, I need a little slow snap from everybody, because this is a beat poem. Here it is: Hey daddy-o, you get hip to some knowledge, it's up from the school of hard knocks, not some stuck up college, I know the Man's gonna try to shut me down, lock me up, send me off to Vietnam, but I've got to speak the truth, little hepcats and kittens, because that's who I am. See right here is a box of things that corporate America wants you to buy, wants you to toe the party line! Cut your hair, shave your goatee, and subscribe! But me and the Ginchee guys down at Vitamin Village say no, you dig? No to the fat cats, the stick suits, and the company pigs! We're dragging our cigs and take a swig of moonshine. Dump this crate on the floor and look at this so-called-- actually, it's really cool stuff; it's some really awesome stuff-- Doctor Strange! That cat is swell! Fantastic Beasts looks crazy as hell! The box can fold out too, and that's jazzy! Ignore what I said before, I was just spazzing! So yeah! Loot Crate, steal my soul, give me a discount, using CriticalRole!

<dt><a href="#l0h2m50s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m50s">All righty. Setting up here for the next bout of announcements. First off, thank you to all those who tuned in to our first episode of Talks Machina earlier this week. It's our first episode, and as first episodes are usually fraught with much peril, difficulty-- technical and mental. We hit our stride about halfway through, I felt and I hope you guys enjoyed it. Those will be up Thursday at 7:00. We'll have a few cast members come in and talk to our fantastic host Brian Foster, he is fantastic, show him some support. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h2m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m26s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m26s">It was so much fun, getting to talk about all the shit we never actually get to talk about with other people. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h3m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m31s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m31s">Yeah, me and Marisha had opportunities every now and then on certain Periscopes to kind of chat a little bit in post-game conversations, really cool to have a space to do that. That's the thing, too, guys, please send in your questions. They're extremely helpful, and I like the idea that we can have some great thoughts without just reading from a chat room that's scrolling at a thousand miles per hour. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h3m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m58s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m58s">Oh, this is so exciting! All right, so these fabulous bracelets and those pins that you guys ordered a while ago? Those are shipping out next week, you guys, so look forward to that! You remember the limited edition patches that we had from Comic Con? We got more of those! So those are back in the store tonight, as well as if you go there right now, you may notice we have a limited run of more Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirts, as well as some How Do You Want To Do This t-shirts, and I know those are probably going to sell out pretty fast, but they will be back in the store in a couple of weeks, so if you order now, you might get them before Christmas in a couple weeks. I don't know, but we're doing our best. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h3m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m2s">Like Donald Sutherland in The Body Snatchers! Perfect! Perfect. I'll probably do that from now on. Next announcement. It recently kicked off, Patrick Rothfuss started a wonderful charity these past couple of years called World Builders. You can find it at worldbuilders.org and he's asked us to help be part of that process, to promote it, to get the word out there and hopefully next year be even more involved on a physical level. But if you want to check it out, it's a fantastic gathering of authors, writers, and creative minds to help bring together those of our community to help make the world a better place. Go check it out at worldbuilders.org, see if it's something you want to be a part of, donate what you can. It's a fantastic cause, and they've done incredible work these past few years. So we invite you to join us as I'm also giving a bunch to it, and we're helping to keep this promo chain going for the next month, as long as it's going, so go ahead and take a look, and be a part of it. Thank you, Patrick, for including us in this awesomeness. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h5m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m2s">We're happy to be a part. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h5m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m2s">Also! We have a new round of playlists that have begun. We did the character playlists last year that seemed to go over pretty well. The first one went up last week with Vax's playlist. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h5m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m53s">They just announced it today, for those who've been keeping along with Force Grey, which we did earlier this year with Dungeons and Dragons and Nerdist, we finished out on a cliffhanger, and now we're going to be finalizing and finishing the final episode on December 5th, live from the Egyptian Theatre here in Hollywood. They put out a cool poster today designed by the same artist who did the Stranger Things cover, and you get to see me Stranger Things-ified, I guess, if you would, on the cover. You can check out either my Twitter or the official Dungeons and Dragons Twitter for more information on that as it comes out by December 5th, it will also be livestreamed, so if you can't be there in person, it will be available on the internet via Twitch for you to watch live, at your leisure. Looking forward to that, and hope you check it out and like it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h6m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m53s">And last but not least, next week is Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h6m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m53s">We will not be having an episode next week, because we're all going to probably be with our families and out of town and eating a lot of food and enjoying the tryptophan. Hope you are doing the same. We'll miss you guys next week but we'll be back the week after at the beginning of December for the rest of this absolute basket of chaos. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h6m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h8m22s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m22s">Without further ado, let's go and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role! [dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h8m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m59s">And welcome back. As we last left off, Vox Machina, in their trek to take down the Chroma Conclave, have been acquiring the Vestiges of Divergence, ancient artifacts from a long-ago historical battle. They've gathered most each and every one, with one final one remaining. They pushed the timeline for their encounter with the Chroma Conclave forward at a rapid pace, and in the process of getting ready for this final encounter with Thordak, The Cinder King, the great, swollen, powerful ancient red dragon who lords over Emon and Tal'Dorei, you took a trip to the Fire Elemental Plane to retrieve the final Vestige known as the Plate of the Dawnmartyr for your fantastic gnome cleric, Pike. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h9m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m59s">Upon making your way there to the City of Brass, a very tyrannical society and a large, ancient city run by efreet, you encountered some interesting characters in Senokir and Uten, a fire genasi and a tiefling. Two partnered jewelers that brought you into their establishment, decided to help you out, threw you in chains to give the image of you being slaves to his business. Brought you guys to speak to a number of the currently free fire giants in the city, as apparently the armor belonged or was won by a fire giant. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h9m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m59s">You managed to, upon asking one named Whaska, got the information and sent you to Juuraiel, a gambler and very well-off fire giant, one of the few responsible for selling the rest of their people into slavery here within the City of Brass, in which a card game was not won. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h9m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m34s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m34s">It was this close! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h11m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m37s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m37s">This close every single time! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h11m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m39s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m39s">Yeah! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h11m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m40s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m40s">That was kind of absurd. However, you were given the option, as opposed to now having sold yourselves into slavery to the giant, to instead do this grand favor for them. Apparently, the past lover of this giant was killed in the streets by a pit fiend named Ghurrix who occasionally wanders the slave district called the Arches here in the City of Brass. You agreed to go find and kill this pit fiend out of vengeance for the giant and as such you would be freed from your current onus and be given the armor that is in the possession of Juuraiel, this giant, as well, so everything should be great. You guys applied a Seeming enchantment across the party, allowing most of you to look kind of like copies of Vex and Vax, the sexy sextuplets, as you put it. The kind of things you'd want to purchase. Made your way to the slave market called the Arches, with Scanlan Shorthalt disguised as a flame-wreathed azer, a Fire Plane dwarf. You proceeded to try and sell this party to the pit fiend, Ghurrix, as he walked through the area. After acquiring and purchasing two celestial-blooded boys who were on another slavery block. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h11m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m58s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m58s">Altar boys. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h12m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h13m0s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h13m0s">That's disgusting. Bait. And it was bait and it's worked out well so far as it got the attention of the pit fiend. The pit fiend wandered to where you had set the entrance to your mansion, Scanlan. Upon some conversation, seemingly were unable to convince the pit fiend to suddenly step into this unsafe, spectral doorway that you had attempted to coax him into. As many of you emerged into the street, with Pike and Percy hiding within the mansion, the rest of you set the stage here at the mouth of this alleyway, the nearby bubbling of a lava stream just off to the right side of you. Keyleth, hidden in the back of the alleyway, decided that, while this moment was still tense, to use the element of surprise and attempted to Feeblemind the pit fiend. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=0h13m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m0s">Unfortunately, it was resisted by the creature, who then, as an instinctive reaction, summoned a friend known as an erinyes from the Nine Hells to join Ghurrix at his side.

You find yourselves suddenly shift once more, the air almost escaping your lungs as that cold sensation grasps your torso and you feel like you're being thrust through a doorway. Suddenly, it comes back and the warmth hits you once again of the sunlight. You open your eyes, and you're standing in the Othendin Pass once more. Though not as you left it. There are billowing clouds of black in the air around you. You hear the shouts in the distance as the fort itself is currently under siege. You see what appears to be dozens of flying creatures currently swooping in and attacking. Most of the landscape here has been recently charred or burned. The bits of scrubland that you see have been burned to small ashy cinders. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L4Sb53wvbKI&t=3h41m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
