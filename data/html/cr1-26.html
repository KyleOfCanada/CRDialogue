<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone and welcome to Critical Role: an online show on Twitch where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors roll dice and play Dungeons and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer. I'm the Dungeon Master. For returning fans, welcome, and for new folks, prepare. A couple of fun things to announce: first things first, unfortunately we are down a Percy this evening. Our buddy Taliesin picked up a con plague in Alaska this past weekend. He had a great time, but came back very ill and has been trying to get better, and is unable to make the game tonight. Which makes the current storyline a little interesting, but we'll work it out. It's fine. No Mercy Percy is going to have some business he's attending to. Thank the Critters for that. That's an awesome hashtag! So Taliesin, I hope you feel better. We miss you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">Next week we continue that arc. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">Let's see, first and foremost, still every 100 subs we get on the channel we have a giveaway to someone who's active in the chatroom. The winner of that giveaway gets a signed picture of the cast of Critical Role, as well as a signed poster by our amazing artist Kit Buss, who was with us for our last session. Those are both given away to whoever wins that, so keep those subs going. Also, there is currently going around a hashtag: No Shave 'Til 10k. A number of people on the stream are a part of that. All sexes can compete and be a part of this, too. No Shave 'Til 10k. If you want to be a part of that, go ahead and tweet that out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">Get that hashtag going and I'll see if I can convince Marisha to let me do that. We'll see. At the very least, for my Halloween costume. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">All right, so other cool things to talk about: all of tonight's donations are going towards the Extra Life charity. The Extra Life charity is a drive that's part of the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. A lot of great people in the community have been supporting this and we're supporting that tonight. So any donations tonight will go to Extra Life. Also over the next two days, we will also be streaming here at Geek and Sundry doing a lot of other charity events for the Extra Life charity drive, including a small DND game-- some of us-- on Saturday evening with the Vox Moronica crew. So that should be fun. Come check that out! Oh, Dungeons and Dragons, the official Wizards of the Coast folks are also doing their Extra Life stream over the next 48 hours. They're just going to be doing live DND streams as well. So starting tomorrow at noon through Sunday at noon, just constant DND on the Wizards of the Coast stream as well. And all of that is going to be raising money for Extra Life. So you'll have a lot of things to keep you busy this weekend essentially. So there's that. Also, we have New York Comic Con coming up in just a couple of weeks. Excited about that, for all you guys. We have panels on Saturday. Do we have times for those yet? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m8s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m8s">Between 1:00 and 4:00 is when we're doing stuff. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h3m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m11s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m11s">Yeah, between 1:00 and 4:00. We have about an hour panel in there somewhere and then probably two hours of signings at the event on Saturday. So 1:00 and 4:00! Leave that period of time open. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h3m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m11s">Hang out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h3m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m20s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m20s">We'll have prints! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h3m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m22s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m22s">Exactly! And then on Sunday, outside of the convention, because we know a lot of the badges were snatched up before this announcement even happened and a lot of the Critters aren't able to make it to the actual con. On Sunday, we're looking around midday. We don't have a time or location determined yet, but that will be up on Twitter soon. It's going to happen. We're going to have an offsite Critter meetup. Where we're going to all be able to be there, hang out with you guys and catch up, sign stuff, say hi, and have a good time. So watch Twitter. If you don't follow us on Twitter, do it, because we'll have those announcements coming up very soon. So excited about that. Liam, you wanted to announce-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h3m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m56s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m56s">Yes! This is the final chance for y'all to jump on Joe Madureira's Kickstarter, Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They have absolutely killed their Kickstarter. They hit their goal, their initial goal about two or three days in, and they have been hitting every single stretch goal they've had. They've got one last mystery stretch goal left to hit. So it's a good time to get in and just get them to the very tippy, tippy top of their campaign, which is about to end. If you guys don't know, really quick, because I've been talking about it for two weeks: Joe Madureira, amazing comic book legend, has drawn everything. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h3m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m56s">It looks like nobody else's and has a good history in game dev as well. Created Darksiders with his company, Vigil Games, that he helped found. And now he has founded Airship Syndicate, and they're making an RPG in the style of JRPGs that you've loved in your lives. But also with Joe's ridonkulous art style. So go get on it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h3m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m52s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m52s">Yeah! Thank you, Liam. Orion, you wanted to say something real fast as well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h4m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m57s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m57s">Yes. Greetings and salutations, everyone! Last week when Kit was here-- Hi Kit, we miss you! We went to It's a Wrap over in Burbank, California. Me and Liam and Laura and Marisha and Kit and her hubby. We were there and saw this robe, and I think Marisha and Laura were like, try it on, and I was like, okay. And I tried it on and was like, oh my god, it was made for me. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h4m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m31s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m31s">The Tiberius robe you always knew-- or didn't know you wanted. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h5m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m35s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m35s">Yeah, totally, I was like, oh my god, and Liam tweeted a picture about it, and then I was streaming on my stream on Twitch and somebody mentioned the robe. And Michael Bauman-- thank you again, I'm going to thank you on Critical Role for-- he donated $400, which was the cost of the robe, and then he just wrote in the chat, this is for the robe, so I'm wearing the robe. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h5m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m3s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h6m5s">Thank you very much. Thank you so much you guys and all you guys who pitched in and stuff. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h6m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m5s">Thank you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h6m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m11s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m11s">We'll find many cool excuses to have that robe be displayed and utilized in many ways. I'm pretty sure he hasn't taken it off since he got it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h6m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m22s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m37s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m37s">I think so. It was very informative. Thank you, Travis. All right, then. Without further ado, let's go ahead and cut to the intro and then we'll jump right into the next episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h6m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h7m56s">Welcome back! So picking up after the events of last week, to give you guys a little bit of a refresher. After the party had returned from their journey into Vasselheim for quite a few weeks, they discovered upon returning that the illustrious Briarwoods, current owners of Castle Whitestone and overseers of the entire city of Whitestone and sticking point in Percy's background, were coming to Emon to meet for essentially a political banquet with Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei to discuss construction of a bridge. It was a very political endeavor. And the council of Tal'Dorei was invited, including Vox Machina. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h7m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m56s">There was a week of preparation in going into this event to see exactly what the Briarwoods were about. Information was gathered at this banquet. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h7m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m56s">Vax went on his own little adventure into the Briarwoods' room, in which they nearly killed him. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h7m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m56s">(chuckles) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h7m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h9m6s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h9m6s">Hey, everybody! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h9m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h9m7s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h9m7s">I didn't notice the shirt until now. So yeah, the party rushed out to his aid. Much violence ensued. The Briarwoods eventually escaped through some sort of magical means that was not uncovered. However, they are no longer in the picture. The party was left with a destroyed carriage, a young carriage driver who had his hand shot off by Percy, and was then told to the guards to haul off and bring to their keep to throw into their cell for further questioning. Uriel was eventually drawn out and confused by the sudden chaos and vehemently requested that Vox Machina return the next morning to go over what has transpired. After which, the party during this event had encountered a tiefling by the name of Lillith, who was masquerading as one of the servants within the palace of Tal'Dorei. Aided them in the battle and revealed that she was being hunted by her sisters in a distant land and revealing herself here essentially opened up her physical presence to be pinpointed and then immediately sought and hunted by whoever was after her. The party then brought her back to the keep. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h9m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m7s">They were on the way back before they were encountered by this bounty hunter and a small team of individuals that were coming with him to seek down, capture Lillith, and bring her back to her sisters. The party then defended her in this circumstance, brutally murdering one of them. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h9m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m7s">Sorry, brutally murdering two of them. One of which was then raised and sent off as a present to the sisters by Lillith. One was salvaged, not given an honorable death, and sent to find his way somewhere northwest of Emon. Possibly towards Vasselheim or wherever else he may find his adventure. They then gave Lillith the opportunity to come stay the night to rest in the keep and they all made their way back to Greyskull Keep for the evening. And that was where we left off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h9m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m7s">So as the evening progresses you all manage to get your rest and gather your thoughts over the rather stressful experience you had the previous evening within the palace. The next morning comes around. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h9m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m7s">You all come to consciousness. Breakfast is prepared by the servants of the keep. As you all wake up, start getting your meals and gathering what you want to do for the day, two individuals have not come down for their meal. Lillith and Percy. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h9m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h27m50s">There are very rare whispers of any sort of cases out there, and usually as soon as something comes to any sort of public knowledge, large mobs gather and whoever was infected with this horrible state was hunted down and killed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h27m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h27m50s">What you do learn from this is religious symbology, while classically thought to have an effect on people afflicted with vampirism, actually has no effect. It's more of a superstition, but does not actually have any negative impact on the individual. However, certain things that do render a vampire easier to destroy: the presence of sunlight. Anything that counts as sunlight can damage them progressively the longer they're in it, prevent them from restoring their health, and ultimately destroy them and turn them to ash, should they be brought to the brink of death in the presence of sunlight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h27m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h27m50s">Also, very quickly and consistently rushing water. Being held into a rushing stream or under a waterfall would have a similar effect to sunlight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h27m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h27m50s">You do also know the stake in the heart is also considered to be a way to destroy them. It does not actually destroy them, but it does render them paralyzed and has to be done when they're in their resting place, within their coffin and/or the dirt that is considered their resting location. Usually that is the beginning step: to find and locate where the vampire is resting, stake in the heart, and then carry the body to sunlight or rushing water. And that's how they're permanently destroyed. You also find out that if a vampire is thought to be killed under any other circumstances, the body turns to mist and is nigh invulnerable and eventually finds its way back to wherever they've hidden their resting place to recover within a very short period of time, making them extremely dangerous, unless you have the right situation, the right conditions, to bring them to that point. So that information is now at your disposal. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h27m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h38m24s">You make your way to the palace of Tal'Dorei, through the front doors. The guards that are there lead you in and one of them says, "Uriel is waiting within the throne chamber."

Sometimes it's just a belt. And I lost it here the other night. And I'm really hoping-- I mean, it ties everything together.

<dd id="l0h39m24s">As you head down the main hallway-- and you recall this hallway. This was a long, dangerous trek the first time you came to the palace. This was where Uriel's family was possessed. This is where you had your battle with the glabrezu. This is where Pike was slain. This is where you had to pull the shadows from the bodies of his family. This is a very emotional place that you really haven't been to since that sequence of events. Walking in already has this tenuous state of low-simmering energy. As you're brought into the main chamber, you can see there is the dual thrones for Uriel and his wife. His wife is not present; his family is not present, just Uriel sitting on the throne. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h39m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h39m24s">There are a few guards on the different entrances to the room. As you walk in, Uriel just sits there on the throne and gives you acknowledgment and ushers you into the room. You all step in. Trinket behind you keeping an eye out. Like a bear is wont to do. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h39m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h39m24s">You guys make your way up towards the very edge of the central raised dais where the thrones are currently set up on. You now see on the opposite side of the room, Seeker Asum and Allura walk in, as well as Arbiter Brom, who is the cleric that is the Master of Law in the city. They walk up and flank the sides of the throne, stepping back a little bit to not gather all the attention, but definitely be there as a show of support. As they enter, the doors on the other side of the room and the door behind you open, and roughly 30 guards enter the chamber quietly. They all filter in, blocking all the exits. The doors close. No weapons are drawn, but there is a very strong showing of muscle in this room that you weren't expecting for this meeting. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h39m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h39m24s">Once all the guards are settled and a really awkward silence hits the room, Uriel stands up from the throne and looks upon you. Pacing slightly, back and forth. "Thank you all for "joining me. I must say, I am troubled by recent events, and I wish to speak to you regarding them "before taking any action. I owe you that much for all you've done for me. Before you left for "Vasselheim, you showed immediate interest in the Briarwoods. Percy in-- Where is Percival?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h39m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

I, through trust, did not inquire as "to why. But upon your return, eagerly told you they were coming to this feast and invited you as "part of the Council of Tal'Dorei to join this feast, as it was your request. I graciously "followed through. You showed up. A meal was had. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h42m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m12s">Questions were asked, although curious ones; I did "not pry. Now I have since been notified, and seen a bit of the aftermath, that you, Vox Machina, "seemingly attacked our guests shortly-- please. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h42m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m12s">Listen. Attacked our guests shortly after the meal "in their own guest quarters. Forcing them to flee, after you destroyed the hallway, ruined their "carriage, murdered two of their guards, two more outside, and leaving Seeker Asum to witness this "entire process." Asum gives a nod. "You then tortured their carriage driver, requested he be "sent to the dungeon beneath your keep. And upon my sentries returning from Greyskull to deliver him, "they find a freshly murdered old woman not far behind the path you took. Not long after, Seeker "Asum found me and corroborated most of this unexpected, violent behavior. I then asked Arbiter "Brom here to divine the nature of this murder. And through his divine sight, through the goddess "Ioun, comes to tell me it was none other than you, Tiberius, that slaughtered this elderly woman "while she slept." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h42m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h44m5s">"Now, I am quite disturbed by the events of these past 14 hours, and I would like to hear an "explanation. Arbiter, if you could please, prepare the space." Arbiter Brom steps forward and pulls forth from underneath his robes a necklace that contains a holy symbol. The same symbol you saw across the temple beneath the Slayer's Take, an eye-like inscription of the god Ioun. Brom grasps it, looks about you all, and prepares this slight hand gesture, and you feel a slight tingle across the skin that lasts a few seconds. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=0h44m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l1h26m7s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h26m7s">Okay. In researching what they have at their disposal, you understand that the Feywild itself, because it is a separate plane, the magics to traverse it are a little more difficult to do. If you notice-- and I'll confirm here just to be sure that we're on the same page-- before I go full on this here. Pardon me, just a moment while I scan through the book. The mighty book. The book of might. Yes. Sigils of teleportation require the same plane of existence, meaning you can teleport anywhere within the Prime Material Plane that you exist in. To traverse into the Feywild, you have to actually find a door into the Feywild, and then you would be able to use a sigil from the Feywild. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h26m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h28m8s">Okay. Through your research, you do find a sigil to Westruun. This is allowing you to go into this portion for this sigil because you've already used the favor that you had to get the sigil of Kraghammer. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h28m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h28m30s">Right, the favor for Gilmore. All I'm saying is, you've used one of two favors to get that sigil. You have to invoke Gilmore's favor to get this one. Okay.

You don't know where in Westruun, but you are connected there. If you choose to teleport there, you know how to. That favor has now been used by Gilmore, so you can mark that.

<dd id="l1h53m41s">He goes, "Look, my father worked for the de Rolo family before the Briarwoods came. My father "vanished the night of their fall. My mother was taken in madness and lost to the night this past "year. I was left alone. However, I knew the roads well between here and Whitestone and places "between, growing up, traveling with my father. So I was made to be a coachman for the new nobles. I "was paid, albeit little, and I was left alone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"Now, when I say the new nobles, there were nobles that lived in Whitestone and worked along with the "de Rolos, and they helped oversee parts of the town, the business, and the people. They had been "there for many generations of their respective families, all under the de Rolos' guidance. But "the night the castle fell, those nobles were dragged out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"It's strange. I mean, after the brutality of that first night, it took days before the people of "Whitestone knew what had happened. We saw the fires, we heard the battles, but no word of the victors "until three days had passed. We were too scared to approach. By then, the Briarwoods called a town "meeting. They explained their new rule over the town. A number objected, which is expected. Many "strong-willed folk in Whitestone, those days. They were subsequently shot down at arrow-point. The "rest were quiet. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"They then dragged out the noble families and executed them, gifting their property and titles to the "various cut-throats and mercenaries they had hired, brought across the channel to help them "take the town. They're not just two people; they've used a lot of money and influence from wherever "they came from and brought a whole slew of very dastardly folk, who have since been given the "titles once held by the other nobles of Whitestone, living in their homes, taking their "tithes and most of the profits made from the businesses they've forced us to continue to run from within "the city. A number of families fled into the woods the night after the executions, using the shadows "of a moonless evening to keep safe. They were all found hanging from the Sun Tree the next morning. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"They kept things going as they were, mostly: farming, logging, manning the white marble mines. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"Business went as usual, all filling the pockets of the new nobles and the Briarwoods. We were given "food, kept our immediate property. As long as we didn't attempt to leave, we were promised safety. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"That lasted for a few years, until the nobles grew bored. Twitchy. They began to abuse the "people of Whitestone: scare us for fun, brand, cut, steal the children, leave them back, "destroyed. They treat us like animals. Folks went missing. I was beaten so bad by my employer, Count "Tylieri. But Lord Briarwood noticed, one night he was passing through the city. He saw wounds on my "back when he was meeting with Count Tylieri. When he asked me in private how I got them, I couldn't "lie. Couldn't resist him. He has a way of drawing the truth out of you. Now, he told me this "unrefined violence was boorish to him and his wife. That was the last I ever saw of Lord "Tylieri. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"Lord and Lady Briarwood took me in as their own driver and showed me Tylieri hanging from that "same Sun Tree the next morning. I was thankful, then. In a strange way, life had been so terrible "for so long, it was the first time I saw someone reach out and save me. They took me in as their "driver after that. It was a better thing to be away from the anger and the fists of the thugs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"But the more I got to know the Briarwoods, the more nightmarish I realized they were. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"Behind the walls of that castle was no longer a grand fortress that we heard it was. Seeing it, "keeping watch and guard over our people. No, that was a domain of perverse magics and sacrilege, it was. The "green fog drifting out from the ground where it stood. The same servants still run the halls, but "they aren't living. They're walking vessels of undeath, their flesh slowly tearing away. The "garden in back lies shriveled, a foul green mist forever pouring out. They're excavating something "in the dungeon, plundering pieces. A lot of their attention seems to be down there; I don't know "why. I dare not wander too far down. They bring up old things. Ancient things. Relics, books, bones. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=1h53m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m41s">"You live in that world long enough, you believe there is no way out. Death would be easy, though "I've seen that death is no real end there.

A lot of these are just punched up in the air, like whatever heavy seismic force that created these initially was very localized and very powerful. A lot of the mountains are spire-like. They come up with very sheer sides and you can see why this mountain range is largely not utilized or traversed or generally spoken of often because it's too dangerous for most average folk to even attempt to climb or use for any good reason. The winds are high and powerful here at the tops, as well. And as you're flying around, the winds blowing across, and you get pushed off your course a little bit here and there, but you still keep up, best as possible. You leading the charge. Over about five minutes of searching through this mountain range, you sense that its movement eventually comes to stop. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=3h6m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You come around this one bend and you can see one of the larger mountainous spires that has a lot of trees and green growth towards the top at certain places where the rock juts out and gives a shelf for such greenery to grow, outside of its sheer outside surface. You do see a couple of wings fold in against the moonlight in what looks to be an outcropping. And there are multiple layers of rock shelves on the side of this mountain. And on one of these outcroppings, there appears to be some sort of a nest: a cluster of almost like actual trees and pieces of wood that are all jammed into this giant nest that's nestled against where the shadow and the moonlight are fighting for some sort of visual on it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=3h9m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h13m11s">Okay. Looking over it, there are no loose rocks or boulders. In fact, because of the construction of these mountains, they're solid spires that jut up and then abruptly end. All the erosion that happens here appears to be gradual enough-- that's why the sides of the mountains are so smooth and unclimbable. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_2CCQnD4AQ8&t=3h13m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
