<dd id="l0h0m0s">Welcome guys, glad you could join us tonight. Before we get started on the game tonight, I've got some quick announcements to get through, so bear with us here. First and foremost, we have returning tonight our fantastic sponsor and friend, D&amp;D Beyond! Sam. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m13s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m13s">As we've previously announced, D&amp;D Beyond is contributing $100 to 826LA for every natural one we roll, and that's a lot! Also, as part of the 826LA charity initiative, now that we're way past our $10,000 tier, D&amp;D Beyond has offered up the discount code "826LA" for 25% off the legendary bundle. The legendary bundle includes all the digital materials available on the D&amp;D Beyond site, so check it out now. A quick history lesson: I did some research. D&amp;D Beyond actually, even though it's a popular modern website, it started in the 80s when D&amp;D started to get popular. It didn't catch on because there was no internet, but they still had the website. They did an ad push for it and I found a script from their earliest ad that they put out. It's a little dated. It's a 1980s ad for D&amp;D Beyond, and me and my friends here are going to act it out for you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h0m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m6s">We have another sponsor tonight. We've talked about them a little bit in the past and we're super excited to bring Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire as an awesome sponsor of the show tonight. Once again, from the great Pillars of Eternity series, I was in the first one and all of us are in this one. It comes out very soon, May 8th. It's in the same world, Eora. It's a really fantastic isometric RPG in the classic style of Baldur's Gate. The graphics are beautiful, and the music's incredible. You'd have heard the first game's music all through most of the Critical Role's run so far. It's a great story. For those that have finished the first game, it deals with the god Eothas who is now terrorizing this area called Deadfire. It's very pirate ships and oceanic island travel and it's pretty badass. You get to hear all of us in it and you also get to customize Vox Machina in it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h3m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m13s">If you played the first game, you also get to carry over your save over into the second one and actually have your character and your choices in the first game connect to the new story, which is pretty rad. Check out the new companion voices, play the incredible story, and customize some characters who look like Vox Machina and also sound like them if you so feel like it. You can check it out and buy it at versusevil.com/criticalrole. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h4m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m30s">If we can get 50K, that's 100K that we as a community have raised for this fantastic organization. You guys are amazing! Keep being amazing. Be sure to check with your employer to see if they offer a charity matching program as well, because that's another cool way you can get double bang for your buck to help out with charity organizations, too. Thank you so much, guys, for being awesome. Critical Recap just came out for last week's episode. If you haven't checked that out yet, you should've before this episode started! If you missed that and didn't watch last week's episode, you'll be very confused. If you have a friend who's behind and wants to catch up with the live stream, Critical Recap is a great way to get them caught up really quickly so they're not spoiled. Then they can go back and trudge through the previous episodes in a lengthy format. Talks Machina is every Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific time, where our fantastic host, Brian W. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h6m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m30s">Foster, talks about the previous episode. Next week will be this episode of Critical Role with a few guests from the show to come there and talk about what randomness happened in our brain tonight. Check that out. Podcast of last week's episode is available where all fine podcasts are available for download. To remind you, because it's been a few weeks, I'll be at Otafest at Calgary May 18th to 20th. Not that far from now, just a few weeks. Be seeing some of you Canadian folks. I'll be at A-Kon in Texas June 7th to 10th, so look forward to seeing you guys there. I think, unless there's anything else I missed, that's all the announcements we have in log. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h6m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h9m32s">Welcome back, everyone. Last we left off: The Mighty Nein, after being in proximity to some sort of an assault from Xhorhasian operatives in the city of Zadash here in the center of the Empire, they found themselves also caught up in a murder of the High-Richter in the city. They pulled away and realized there was a manhunt for individuals that were seemingly seen in connection to this murder. As this was transpiring, they had to smuggle out some allies they had found and had been working with, Dolan and Horris. Dolan, part of this whole deal was to get him involved in the local politics. Horris needed to be smuggled out for safety in case they got caught. You made your way to the Evening Nip, met up with Yasha. Down there, you had a conversation with this individual called The Gentleman. You made a deal. You've decided to trust each other on this endeavor and basically do a quid pro quo. A little favor to one, favor for the other and see if this is a business relationship you would want to develop. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h9m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m32s">In doing so, Horris was smuggled out of the city. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h9m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m40s">I keep saying that because you weren't there to confirm! I don't want to say that it happened because the mystery's fun. You were brought down through the tunnels to the Underworks, towards an underground dock, where the river that exited to the northeast towards Berleben was. You loaded up on boats to make your way towards a recently uncovered but barely explored underground research facility, long buried. The Gentleman asked you to enter it, see what you found, clear it out if possible, and return. As you made your way down there, assailed by a few of the creatures that existed in that tunnel, you found the exterior of this research facility, broke your way in, began to meander around and discover strange mysteries afoot in its construction. The urns throughout the vicinity, the strange wisps of spiritual energy came to assault you in the process. Bypassing traps, mostly, kind of. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h10m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h11m37s">Completing the mystery of the strange arcane runes in the ceiling and the schools of magic that they seemed connected to, found your way into some sort of a secret study or den, where there were research tables set up, and a mostly empty bookshelf, braziers filled with ash to the side between pillars, two small chambers where these cages with tight knit bars remained, containing urns and empty nooses hanging above.

This large, tattered cloak of a figure, spreading, whipping around like this sudden wind is tossing aside sails of a dark ship. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=0h11m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Either by the previous denizen, who lived here, that you destroyed, or somebody else that had been here in here before.

<dd id="l2h1m9s">The sleep takes you and the darkness of your dream state alleviates you of the stress of the day. Your aching muscles turning numb, your physical form and consciousness now removed and aimless in this dark space. You look down at your hands, and there you see clasped in your grip the hooked and curved blade that you had recently bound with. In your grasp, you swing it and slowly inspect as you do. As you swirl the blade around in your hand, it almost has a trail around it. As you hold it coldly in you grasp, this yellow light suddenly emerges in front of you, as a familiar, large, yellow eye now looks upon you. A voice fills you, directionless, "Consume." You glance at the blade and back at the eye and the voice again says, "Consume." What do you do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=2h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h3m29s">As you begin to force it down your gullet, you feel the edge of the blade hit the back of your throat and a moment of pain hits you as it begins to cut through your flesh. At that point, this ravenous hunger begins to build on the inside of your stomach. Though the pain tells you to pull away, you continue to force the blade down. As you pull it down from the hilt, you feel the blood burble up in the back of your throat and spill out of your chin but you continue to push it until the entirety of the blade is consumed within your throat. You close your eyes for a moment and look up at the eye once more. The voice returns to fill, reverberating around you. The pain subsides and it says, "Good." The eye closes. The lid completely cutting of the source, the cold, the liquid, the water around you the sense of being under the ocean again begins to whisk you away. A heavy current begins to pull from behind and you reach out trying to grasp for any hand or foot hold. Yet you have nothing to hold on to. As you feel yourself being dragged into this endless abyss, the dream comes to an end. You wake up. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=2h3m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you approach, waiting for you, sitting in the same position up there, that older, crusty-looking fella named Rodel, who you had met on the way out, and Kara, leaning against the back wall. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=2h33m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There is no barkeep at the bar and there are no patrons in there. The ogre guard is there in the corner. Looks a little groggy and recently come to consciousness and is feasting on a whole side of pig that has been cured and salted. It hasn't been butchered, literally tearing off the bone of the half of the pig and sees you enter and (grunts) and continues eating. On the balcony across the way, as soon as you enter, you can see at the top, there is the female goliath, Sorah, who is standing there and looking down at you as you enter and gives a head nod of acknowledgement.

Some voices on the inside and a voice goes, "Ah. Just a moment. I'm sorry. Got some business." Then coming out from behind the curtain, you see The Gentleman in this long deep purple silk robe that is tied around the waist and goes, "(laughter) Well, you've returned." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=2h37m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h7m57s">Okay. You wait for a while, and see a moment where it is relatively calm. The outside of the shrine is this iron obsidian archway that stretches up about 20 feet to frame a small shrine, topped with a statue of the Matron, and her ravens about her, this circle of ravens that curves around. You see the female figure standing in stone, the sculpture of the porcelain face-- the only material that's not the same as the darkened stone around her-- it's a white porcelain mask that is affixed to the front of the statue. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=3h7m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h7m57s">At the base of it, you can see a number of bowls and offerings that have been left around from people that have come and passed through. Beyond that, there is a door to the small shrine behind it, it's this small structure. Maybe 20 feet by ten feet. It's not a very large shrine. You've seen groups of people that function as morticians, in long dark robes and dark clothing, that have entered and exited this facility. You wait for a while, as there is one body that's being interred at a family plot, and then as they all begin to scatter, you see a few other leave, and at that moment, the interior, from what you can tell, is empty, or at least you've watched three individuals leave. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lT-wFK4SgJc&t=3h7m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

That's where the Ashguard Garrison is and the Rockguard Garrison. That's where most of the battle takes place. That's the protection border that The Empire holds to keep the Xhorhasian hordes and creatures from the waste to wander in. Although many still filter through the mountains and such.
