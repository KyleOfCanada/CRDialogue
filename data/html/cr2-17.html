<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. We'll jump into the game here shortly, but we have some quick announcements to get through. First and foremost, congratulations Sam on his Emmy win!

<dd id="l0h0m45s">This enchanted statue was given to the finest of "creatives in the land. It's a large thinly-coated lead icon made of cheap material." I'm going to take a picture of that later. That's so cool! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h0m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m2s">That object brought to you by our first sponsor tonight and sponsor for the campaign thus far, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Sam? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h1m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m11s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m11s">Guys, as you know, this week I received many emails from fans who loved our D&amp;D Beyond ad last week. And they told me that I had missed part of the story. To recap, our sponsor is D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h1m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m11s">They are contributing $100 to 826LA for every natural one we roll. Also, as part of their massive 826LA charity initiative, we're past the $10,000 tier, so D&amp;D Beyond has offered up the discount code "826LA" for 25% off their awesome Legendary Bundle, which includes all the digital materials available on D&amp;D Beyond. Last week, to honor that, I had dug through the archives and found a commercial that D&amp;D Beyond had run in the '80s. We did a staged reading of it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h1m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m7s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m7s">It was great. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h2m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m8s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m8s">Fans wrote in and said, "Sam, you missed part of that story." The ad campaign in the '80s was not successful. However, it launched the career of the young actress who played Gail in the commercial. She was given her own spin-off sitcom on CBS. It only ran four episodes, and those episodes have been lost to time. But I was able to find the script of a promo for the sitcom starring Gail, from the D&amp;D Beyond commercial, from the 80s! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h2m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m39s">Thank you, Sam. Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for making this happen. We have another sponsor returning this week: our friends at Obsidian for <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h5m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m46s">First off, for those who aren't familiar with it, Pillars of Eternity was a great RPG. Isometric, classic-style RPG for PC and console later this year. You get to return to the world of Eora. This one is on the hunt for one of the gods, Eothas, which plays into the story from the first game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h5m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m46s">You don't have to have played the first one to play the sequel, because they have built in a way that gets you up to speed very quickly and basically choose your decisions that you start the game to still influence the story and where you're going. A lot of the main characters in the story are voiced by us here at the table! Which is awesome. For a free DLC download, you'll be able to download the portraits of Vox Machina as well as voice sets to use in the game for your main character and entire party. Check it out if you haven't had a chance yet. It's an awesome RPG series. Unbiased as I couldn't possibly be because I was one of the first Kickstarter backers before I was even part of the game. It's great. I really enjoyed it. Check it out if you can. It comes out next week on Tuesday, May 8th. You can order it at versusevil.com/criticalrole. They've released almost all the portraits so far, just in the past couple of days. They've released Keyleth and Grog today. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h5m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h12m24s">Daredevil Laura Bailey, ladies and gentlemen. Bringing it back in. The Mighty Nein in the city of Zadash. Long in the Dwendalian Empire, you've made a small name for yourself in a few factions. You've done a deed or two for the King's Hall here in service of the Crown. You've done a deed or two with the Knights of Requital, that involved getting caught up briefly in a manhunt, as you were loosely responsible for the death of the High-Richter, the high judge of the local court. Managed to make an introductory trade, a deal if you will, with The Gentleman, this subterranean figure of not the most legal of maneuvers. You delved deep into one of the subterranean river tunnels beneath the city of Zadash for him, managed to clear out and recover materials from a long-buried research facility from the Age of Arcanum. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h12m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m24s">Upon returning, the deal was solid. You managed to smuggle out Horris, who needed to be away from the town for the time being while this investigation was happening. In doing so, also managed to clear your names of the death of the High-Richter. Upon returning back, getting a few deeds done, now waiting for this to blow over, and hearing word that there is no longer a manhunt for a number of you in cahoots to this, you begin to prepare for the coming Harvest Close Festival. Now we're getting close to the third of the month of Fessuran, you've all managed to prepare in the ways you want, got a few things on your side. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h12m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m24s">You've delved into some of the mysteries of the beacon that you maintain. You've retrieved your Forever Alcoholic Flask. That's where we'll begin today. Friends, as the early morning creeps up upon you, the chilled morning air has left a bit of ice and mist crawling across areas of the city floor, from outside your window here in the Leaky Tap tavern. However, though it is a gloomy morning, there is already a general air of celebration around. Glancing across, more people are now shifting out into the street and city around you. Music is beginning to creep into the vicinity, and you can hear muffling through the nearby walls. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h12m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h28m48s">At this point now, the chilled late morning beneath the cloud covered skies, the streets are filled with all manner of people and families walking with baskets and colored streamers behind them. The large banners of silk of the autumn colors that were previously being placed up in the streets are in full display. The gentle wind is causing them to flicker and flap as the music weaves with the sound of the fabric. Small bands of bards and musicians mark nearly every street intersection, filling the air with music, poems, and cheer. It's a very stark difference to the lock-down that held the city over the past week and a half or so. The closer you begin to follow the crowds as they move along, hearing the chuckles of children and the conversations and laughter that seem to burble out of every street corner, it pushes you in the direction of the Pentamarket. That's when the smells of spices and incense begin to come in waves as you follow the sauntering crowds, eventually that smell overcome by the smell of cooked meat pies and roasted vegetables billowing from the various food carts that line the corners of the streets before you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h28m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>

To the left, you can see someone loudly proclaiming, "Want to play Trebuchet, anyone?" and down the way another voice calling out, "King's "Vault!"

In fact, Trebuchet, as you approach, you see two guards, male and female, that are both in the process of lifting a three or four year old girl, and she has a sandbag in her hand. They're like, "One, two, three!" and she throws it and it gets close, but stops before the basket, but they cheer her on, "Yay!" and set her down. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h31m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h43m45s">You glance around, keeping an eye open as you guys continue. You've now hit the deeper edge of the Pentamarket. The crowds around you are fairly dense at this point. There are people laughing and talking. They're carrying various baked goods that are fresh out of the nearby carts or oven. The smell creeps into your senses and takes over from that point. Children run past and bump you in the side. Some are holding two ends of a streamer, and the streamers continue past and flap around, hitting people. It's adorable and delightfully intense. The guard presence is very much felt here, but everyone is in high spirits. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h43m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You manage to find a small meadery stand that's near the outskirts of one of the large arena structures, that you haven't seen used since you arrived in this city. As you approach, the older guy there, with this curled and unkempt chin-beard that looks like part of it isn't growing on the right side.

<dd id="l0h46m49s">It sets well, and it's <i>strong</i>. As you guys are walking around and keeping an eye, you do see there is another stand that has an elevated platform called Titan's Grasp. There are four soldiers of the Righteous Brand, the Empire Military, that are currently manning it. They're wearing their plate mail of silver and dark-crimson design. A large, cubed stone, two feet by two feet, is set on top of this platform with a metal bar that is wedged beneath it, that it's leaning against. The metal bar has a cylindrical center point, like a fulcrum. There is a large hammer, that one of them is currently holding to the side. As you begin to approach, you see one guy there, who's currently spitting into his hands, grabs the hammer (grunts). As he hits the metal bar, the stone goes (slight scraping) barely shifts. He sets down the hammer and everyone's like: "Yay" and he goes, "I moved it!" Steps down off the platform. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=0h46m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You've passed it before, and you can see it's the domed, iron structure. It's been left to rust a bit at the edges. The tops of the dome are polished where it's easily accessible, but the very peak of the dome is a little bit red, brown, rusted. There are a number of open arches in the inside, and you see the large, central forge that marks the center of the temple. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=1h14m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h28m47s">"Anyone else?" Another gentleman raises his hand and gets up on stage and they begin to do a showdown. The two of them begin to go back and forth. However, that same beastly figure, Kendall, still manages to, defeat the guy and send him to the table, get up again and "Ha!" Then at some point, shortly thereafter, Leopold goes, "Ah, he returns! He returns! (chuckling) Gunther Prast, "our finest soldier here in the city, would like to challenge the current standing contender." You watch now as this massive behemoth of a man, like the Mountain from Game of Thrones, about seven foot, 350 pounds guy wearing the Righteous Brand silver and red armor, gets up onto the stage (heavy steps). Clean-shaven, except for this perpetual five o'clock shadow that doesn't seem to leave his square jaw, his hair is trimmed super short and you see the receding hairline curling back into a widow's peak. Sits on the table, puts his arm out there and you can see the huntsman, Kendall, for the first time, lose his cool. You watch as the two of them grasp together and they're going to begin to roll off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=1h28m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You have muscled your way through the crowd, making your way into the shaded interior of the front portion, the receiving chamber of the Victory Pit, this two-leveled circular forum-like structure in the center of the Pentamarket. You push in the crowd, and people are starting to find each other and push away to find seats into some of the openings that lead off to the sides in the center. There is a pedestal with a barker or an organizer up there in a long dark gray and brown set of robes, a human male in his late 50s who's fighting his own age and losing. The comb-over thinning hair and a broom-like gray mustache that's poorly colored with dark wax. He's shouting out to the crowd, he says, "Please enter slowly, the event begins "shortly in the next few hours. Would you push aside-- (muttering) Yes, right! This way, please, "but go evenly!"

There's a slight hallway that leads into a low-lit lounge with comfortable furniture with cushions, there's some firelight, a few torches set up in the chamber. There is a window across the way that looks out into the open of the Victory Pit's main battle area. You can see servants wandering in similar brown silks and robes as the barker, but they're carrying trays of food. You see guests in expensive clothing that dot the distant walls and areas of the chamber sitting atop these cushioned couches and talking in low voices to each other, broken with the occasional laugh. The older gentleman ushers you over and waves in the distance as a figure begins to approach. This is another human man in probably his early 60s or so, who has graying hair that is slicked back and even further thinned than the gentleman who first met you on the way in, who has a very well groomed goatee that comes to an accentuated curve up underneath in the front.

<dd id="l2h32m54s">There's still stragglers finding their way in, and as the day's sun is getting further into the mid-afternoon, you guys are brought down to an area that is similar to that lounge area, but far less in its decor and comfort. This chamber has two windowed doors on the opposite side that are cut through windows that lead into the central arena. You can smell the dust on the opposite side. The interior is outfitted with about three dozen simple stools that are scattered about, a few tables with cornucopias of fruits and meats that are set, and a few folks you see are feasting on them. There are two stationed healers of the Platinum House of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=2h32m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h32m54s">They are the ones stationed there to prevent folks from dying and the other combatants. In one corner, there are five soldiers of the Righteous Brand, one of which is Gunther, who are in the process of taking large handfuls of food and eating and getting themselves some energy for battle. As soon as you enter, they glance over and give a bit of a nod of notification. Gunther, looking straight to you, grabs an apple of some kind, and throws it at you. "Eat. You'll need it." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=2h32m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h34m52s">It looks like amongst them there is one acting as leader, or at least is in the process of discussing tactics among the small troupe, though you can't hear exactly what he is saying. An elven man with short brown hair, and these sky blue piercing eyes who is in the process of giving orders to them. Then he walks off to the side, pulls a blade out and begins practicing. It's this very elegant, almost dance-like blade technique. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=2h34m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h34m52s">On the opposite side of the room to them, all leaning against the wall, you see five dwarves and two gnomes that are all wearing black and gold variations to armor, robes. They are avoiding all social engagements and staring, mad dogging everyone else in the chamber. As soon as you enter, all their eyes shift in your direction, and they watch you as you step into the chamber. In the center of them, you see a gray haired dwarven women, weathered skin and a surly grin as you approach, gleaming these yellow teeth from beneath, who gives a bit of a squinted stare at you as you pass by. You see two battleaxes resting at the side of her belt, hanging off of her armor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=2h34m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Markings and accessories gives you a sense of inland Menagerie Coast heritage, and there you see Darrow who you had met earlier in the tournament, who's leaning out the window. He turns around as you enter and goes, "Ah, so you did indeed decide to join.

Another one rushes up as it grabs and slams it onto the floor and puts its weight on top of it, one foot pushing it down. Gunther rushes up with a blade and carves into a large section of its face. The crowd goes crazy as it pulls back and shoves Gunther off with a back fist. The elven leader rushes forward and does a few quick swipes with his blade. The large toad creature grabs it and attempts to swallow him, and manages to do so, completely ingests the leader. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=2h43m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Nobody falls, and eventually the general carves his way from the stomach of the beast with a giant swipe of his blade. You watch as the blood begins to pour from it as he leaps out, coated in saliva and the creature's own crimson, spins around, and as the large toad beast pulls back, they all together, with one unified strike, surround and attack it. The beast lumbers forward and falls to the ground, unconscious. With a rousing cheer from the audience, the previous doors open. As the soldiers raise their weapons high and give a respectful bow, they begin to walk back towards the holding area, as they drag the unconscious body of this creature back to where it came. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=2h45m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you push down, you watch your blade actually protrude out the roof of its mouth, through its mouth, through the tongue, and into the rest of its body, and as you push, it gives this horrible squealing, guttural, swine-like sound, and as you push, and push, and push, it falls onto its back, and you keep pushing, and you keep pushing, and the tentacles go limp and release both Jester and Beau.

"The Mountain "Makers from Grimgolir!" The dwarf and gnome troupe makes their way out into the field. As the crowd cheers, the emcee vanishes, and you see an opposing side open once again. Immediately bursting through, you see a large, nine-foot troll with elongated arms and legs start rushing into the fray, screaming this high-pitched yelp. As it runs, you can see its skin, as opposed to the deep forest green that you've read about or seen in trolls in your experiences, this looks like a dull teal-blue color. You watch as the dwarves, all of a sudden, rush in. The gnomes begin casting spells, and this assault goes back and forth. You see with each strike this cold mist off the claws of the troll with each blow. You watch as the gnomes begin to apply fire upon fire, and you watch as the entity burns, their intelligent knowledge of the creature causing it to prevent it from regenerating. Fairly rapidly, they make short work of it. They were prepared, and it was not as intense a battle as you were expecting.

Looking out past the way, another door opens off to the side, and you watch as a 15-foot-long crocodile becomes barreling into the center, its jaws opening and snapping as it comes rushing in. It climbs over the wall that the guys are getting behind to defend and immediately snaps down on one of the soldiers, who gets hit in the side and screams out in pain. They all begin to rush in and assault, jumping off the wall and getting onto its back. You watch as Darrow climbs up onto it, taking a shortsword that one of his friends had dropped, and jams it into the top of the head. As he pulls out his battleaxe, he begins to hack away. He seems to be laughing. Another friend pries the mouth off of the one soldier that had been stamped on. He limps away as it spins around, its tail slapping one of its friends, sending him flying back ten feet as his weapon goes skidding into the sky. It hits the dirt off the way. He runs to try and retrieve it. The battle goes back and forth for a while. One of their friends goes down and one of his allies grabs and pulls him away from the battle zone as he begins to try and wake him up. At this point, you watch as Darrow makes a couple of motions to his friends, and they all cycle in and assault at one time, cutting at the throat of the large crocodile as Darrow takes his axe and carves out one of its eyes. As it pulls back, screaming in pain, they both come underneath and cut through the throat at the same time, causing it to bleed out. With that, the crocodile collapses, not moving, into the field. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h19m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h22m24s">"To the front lines again! The Last Line!" You see as the armored soldiers go back out there into the field. They get into the center. They form a phalanx back to back in the center as they look around in any direction, and you hear (grunting) (roaring) and two gates open. From each gate, two large-looking figures come charging out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h22m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h22m24s">You see these sprinting, dark, humanoid creatures with giant horns out of the front of their head. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h22m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h22m24s">Immediately, they both break into two groups and try to head them off, shields up. One of them gets thrown, taking the impact of the blow. Knocked back onto his ass, three feet back. The other one gets gored immediately, the horns piercing his armor and throwing him into the air. As this happens, you notice now they're both wielding large axes, and they start cleaving into the opponents. They're giving up a good fight, and it goes back and forth for a bit, but at one point you watch one drop, and another drop. A third one gets grabbed and picked up and then broken over the knee of one of the minotaurs. At which point, you see the elven general begins to look around nervously and starts waving his hand to call it off just as one of them gores him from behind. He gets thrown ten feet, landing onto the ground rolling, unconscious. His blade clattering in the dirt. There you see Gunther in the center with two warhammers in his hands, blood down his face going, "Come on!" They both come charging in at him from two different sides. Last minute, he darts backward, causing them to collide into each other. As they're stunned, he rushes up and jams his hammer into the head of one of them. Once. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h22m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h22m24s">Twice. One of the minotaurs goes down, and right as he pulls back, the second minotaur gets him from behind. You watch as a horn pierce where his liver is, and he falls unconscious on the ground. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h22m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h22m24s">They fall. The final minotaur roars up into the air and the whole crowd goes, "Oh!" You watch as two groups come out with chains and manacles and manage to grapple and throw them down. The lasting minotaur passes out in the chains and they drag him back off the field. The two clerics rush out into the field and prevent death to those who are in the process of slipping. With that, The Last Line is pulled back, the first fallen out here in the field. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h22m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h53m27s">As you guys pull back into your chamber, there's a few nods. Darrow's clapping and the rest of his team are clapping. There's a clap from two of the Mountain Makers off to the side. At which point, "The Mountain Makers!" are announced and they step out into the space. As they all gather, hiding in the corner, spreading out a bit, two of the sides open. Out of one, two large furred entities about eight to nine feet tall come rushing in with a combination of fur and feathers, these hooked, dark beaks at the tips of their mouths. Two owlbears come running in and go into an assault on these people. They took some hits in the last battle, and as it goes back and forth, you watch as they're striking it and cutting through. The owlbears are screaming this horrible squeal of pain and anguish combined with ravenous anger, and they start tearing and pulling into them. One of them grabs the gnome in its beak, pulls up and tears its throat out. The gnome gurgles as it falls to the ground. The two clerics immediately come up to the side, getting ready to rush out there to try and save its life. Another one of them manages to hit one of the owlbears in its leg as it falls on the ground and they all start slashing on it. It looks like one owlbear is about to fall as the other one, in a complete frenzy either partnered or what, tears and grabs one of the dwarves and starts biting into its face as it screams, it falls unconscious on the ground. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h53m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h53m27s">It grabs another, and bites into its chest, throwing it into the sky as they spin off to the side. As they all begin to pick up to assault the one that's going after them, the one on the ground slowly gets back up and joins the fray. You watch one by one as these owlbears, on the cusp of dying, tear through the Mountain Makers. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h53m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h53m27s">At which point, the crowd goes like (gasp) "Whoa!" Big cheers. Cheers because it's a display, but also that mournful "Whoa", that low bass-y sound. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h53m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h56m24s">One of them swings and strikes, but as he strikes it passes through and it all of a sudden shifts, and was not in the space where it blow and it pounces onto one of his adventurers. They begin to hack back and forth, crowding up around each other back to back, one of them is pulling out his longbow and letting loose arrow after arrow. Some striking, some missing. One of them all of a sudden the phase is lost, it gets struck, and now it is in a solid place. They use that moment for all of them to dash in and surround this one creature. They manage to, within one round, carve down this one displacer beast on one side, the other pouncing onto Darrow and holding him to the ground. Its back legs clawing into his belly as the others try and pull it off. Darrow takes a serious series of wounds before he manages to pull himself free. The displacer beast grabs another of its friends and snaps him in his face. He falls unconscious and whips around. They strike at it a few times, but they can't seem to find where its body is. It is dodging around until finally Darrow is back up, his face covered in blood, takes his battle axe and swings wide and clocks it in the side of the jaw. Its strange illusion form vanishes at that point, its body coming to a very condensed location. They all swarm this one, and one by one tear it down for the next round. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNOyGusWh3s&t=3h56m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
