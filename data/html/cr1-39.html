<dd id="l0h0m9s">Welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h0m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m13s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m14s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m14s">Exactly. Live internet, it's a wonderful thing. This is why you don't drink before a game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h0m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m14s">All right, so, first and foremost, thank you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h0m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m14s">Welcome. We're jumping in here shortly from a bit of a climatic endpoint last week, but before we get into that, we're going to go ahead and try and cruise through these pre-show announcements. So, first and foremost, I want to let you guys know that the short video series I'm doing for Geek and Sundry, that's GM and DM Tips, launched last week on Friday, and a few videos will be coming out every Friday for the next couple months or so, so every Friday go check that out on GeekandSundry.com to see what other bit of rambling I'm doing and hoping to try and help some of you make your game a little more interesting. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h0m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m14s">So tomorrow I guess is the next one. I'm not quite sure what topic it's on, but it should be fun. So check that out. As a reminder, most of us are going to be present at Wizard World Portland next month. We'll be there Saturday and Sunday for the con, and we'll have a panel both days. I think Saturday is the Critical Role panel, and Sunday is going to be more of a voiceover-related one, so hope to see you guys there. Bring your stuff if you want to have it signed and come get ready to ask questions and hang out, basically. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h0m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m26s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m26s">And also find us during the days in the general hall area, we'll be around quite a bit. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h1m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m33s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m33s">Yeah, we'll be around. So, if you would like to see us possibly come to a Wizard World near you in the future, go ahead and send a tweet to Wizard World's Twitter, and let them know how excited you'd be to see us at more events in the future, because that would make them more inclined to want to bring us to more events! Let's see-- Also as a reminder, me and Marisha will be at Colorado Anime Fest, February 12th through the 14th in Denver, Colorado. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h1m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h2m1s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m1s">Yep, so we'll be out there, hanging with you folks in Colorado. You should come say hello, we'd love to see you. Also, a reminder, the Dungeon Masters Guild, awesome new opportunity for content creators for Dungeons and Dragons. You know, create your own classes, your own rules, your own feats, your own stuff. There's a great place to put it up there, and you can set your price for it. You can check out my most updated version of the Blood Hunter and recently updated Gunslinger, which is now version 1.1, just went up yesterday, so if you have one of those you can update that and get the newest set. A couple minor changes and tweaks. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h2m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h2m36s">Nothing you have to worry about yet. It was mainly the level 15 ability piercing shot and a couple of clarifications that I know. You'll be fine. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h2m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And actually at Kevin Sorbo, second film in a row I get to cast magic at him, pretty excited about that. So check that out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h4m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

So now we've finished all the announcements I believe, if anyone has anything else we're going to go ahead and get into tonight's episode of Critical Role. So, where we left off, our intrepid adventurers, Vox Machina, having returned the traitor Riskel Daxio to Sovereign Uriel in the center of the town of Emon, Grog beheading him as part of his punishment for being such a traitorous worshiper of the evil entity known as Vecna. Upon going out for a pub crawl, came across Gilmore in a secret speakeasy, managed to enjoy a Heroes' Feast at his expense, whereas Vex and Vax both, all of you, got pretty-- Keyleth got very-- drunk. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h7m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

But after which the party found their way back to the Keep, where Dr. Dranzel and his Spectacular Traveling Troupe were drinking and expecting you to be there, in which they could converse and try and convince you of a little caper they've been trying to get their head around for a while, and you seem to have the entry to this possible windfall of money.

Thanks to Scanlan's sudden realization, change of heart, and attempt to connect with his lost blood, broke a bit of that cold honed exterior, and managed to prevent a very dangerous and possibly deadly encounter. She left frustrated and confused, and hasn't been seen since. The rest of you, gathering the next morning, discussed this endeavor with Dr. Dranzel and how they had found a home that had been long abandoned after being purchased by a collector. A home that you guys had ransacked a little over a year before after finding a portal within that led to a dragon's hoard, as the previous person who lived there, General Krieg, was actually a dragon who had infiltrated the Council. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h8m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m4s">They're close. Brimscythe the Dragon was slaughtered in this endeavor, however it's been over a year since. You guys returned to this house, scoured it, found your way through the still existing secret passage that led you to the now partially collapsed cavern, which once housed Brimscythe and his hoard. You found that the tunnel itself, freezing cold, the rubble of the partially collapsed cavern had been ravaged by some sort of large clawed entity that Vex had identified as another equally dangerous dragon that seems to have rummaged through and found the corpse of Brimscythe. You also found that a number of gold coins, a bit of his hoard that had been buried in this, were now exposed by these strange, smooth tunnels that were carved into the rock. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h10m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m4s">Upon you, Scanlan, and Trinket inquiring there, the rest of the party scattered. Pike and Keyleth went to find what seemed to be the owner of the house, now frozen in fright in a far alcove. And the three, the rest of your group, traveling towards the mouth of the cavern itself, before the ground begins to rumble. Suddenly, exploding from the rock and shale of the bottom of the cavern floor, you guys managed to see before you, piercing forth from the ground itself, a very, very large, segmented, armored, worm-like entity. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h10m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h30m45s">All right. So it succeeds its first saving throw and it succeeds its second saving throw. But you do see with each strike the intent of the sword to draw some of the strength and life force from the target. Not really making any effect, unfortunately. All right! Ending your turn, Grog, that vibration you feel in the ground, now? It's curious, because the worm itself is out of the ground, now. What caused you to lose your shot? You feel it grow stronger and stronger, before suddenly, nearby, a secondary, different-looking, but similar in size, worm comes bursting out of the base of the cavern. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=0h30m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h2m13s">18? All right. You disassemble elements of the pistol. You get the feeling that the way it's weighted, to attach the hand mortar to the pistol, it's still going to continue to be a very unwieldy thing. You are probably best to design them as separate pieces. Unfortunately, the way the pistol's balanced, for aim and such? The mechanism that's required to lob an object for the mortar to be able to do any help with is going to throw off your ability to aim much with the pistol, going forward. Not to mention increase the misfire score by crazy amounts. But you could create them both separately and swap out as needed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=3h2m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h23m51s">Yeah! You skip along, the rest of you make your way to the Cloudtop, and you make your way around the stage and it's against the wall, near one of the entrances to the Cloudtop, but on the interior. And you can see there is a rather large stage up against the wall. There is already a crowd gathered. You see merchants, highborn families, political guests, upper-station military, a number of well-dressed representatives from all over Emon have gathered for this. You guys meet up with the rest of the group and you kind of, you know, gravitate. Gilmore gives everyone a quick wave and gives you a respectful nod. "Aha! Yes!" and he wanders off and starts mingling with some of the other guests. Just as the sun vanishes beneath the distant horizon, a procession of palace guards approach the area, the crowd parting, as Uriel arrives with the escort, flanked by his family, and the current inner council of Tal'Dorei with Arbiter Brom, Seeker Asum, Tofor Brotorus. Allura is absent of course, for being in Whitestone. They all step onto the stage along with the guards as well, as cheers and light applause begins to break out. Not crazy go wild, but just like (muted) "Hooray." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=3h23m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h25m17s">Guards have already set up a few chairs on the stage. Uriel begins to sit on one as his family gathers behind it, and he puts his hand out and motions to everybody to go ahead and hush down. As he does, he stands up from his chair. "Friends and family. Allies of this fair "city of Emon. Houses-in-arms to the Tal'Dorei family. Guests, guardians and law-keepers alike. I "thank you for coming on such short notice. Now, it has not escaped me that talk spreads quickly "within these walls, and rumors only seek to undermine trust. It is true Lord Riskel Daxio, "honored member of our council and overseer of development within Emon for many years, has "unfortunately passed away. We mourn our friend, and ask you all to respect his legacy enough to "not to smear his name. That being said, this was just one of many hardships that has befallen our "council and my family this past year. Many that have left me with a terrible burden. We've been "faced with deceit, and I failed to see it. We've been beset with allies in need, and I have been "noncommittal in aiding them. We've been clouded by demonic powers, and I've failed to protect my "family. And my responsibility to all of you. I look back at my bloodline, at my father and his "father before him, and I plainly see what I am not. These times are different. This wonderful "city has grown these past centuries into something grand: a beacon of civilization, here in these "lands that my ancestors gave name to. My family has built us up, and I feel that there is little "more my family can accomplish for the greatness of these lands. It has outgrown our meager guidance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=3h25m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h25m17s">"I did not choose to be your sovereign; it was by blood that I came into this. And I did my very, "very best to live up to your expectations. I can see the future of you all and I wish to safeguard "it, by leaving it not in one hand, but the hands of many. As of the end of this week, I will be "stepping down as your sovereign. The Tal'Dorei bloodline will no longer hold the fate of this "realm. We will instead leave the council to rule." And he looks about at the other council members, on out to you, out to the rest of the group. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9EToAf4nhDw&t=3h25m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h25m17s">"There will be a chosen few, exemplary members of "our society, who will step up and aid in this task, and join the council as well. You, the "peoples of Emon, will be the ones to guide us to a new age of prosperity."

<dd id="l3h25m17s">There's a little bit of confusion in the crowd, but for the most part everyone seems to be into it.

At this point, you guys hear this (whoosh) sound and you turn around just in time to see what looks to be a large, larger than you've seen before, white dragon just slam into the side of Allura's tower in the distance. Claws clunk into the side, digging into the stonework, wings unfurled, it looks into the upper window of where her actual parlor is and peeks in for a second before just unleashing a blast of icy cold magical breath into the inside of the tower. You can see now, screams start tearing around you as the guards start getting their weapons ready. At which point, the dragon pulls its head back and looks about at everyone screaming, and pushes off the tower.
