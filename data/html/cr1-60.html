<dd id="l0h0m10s">All right! (cheers) Welcome! Is my mic on? It's on, whoa, yeah, welcome to the very first inaugural premiere edition of Critical Role live! Guys, my name's Kevin. I am the social media director for Geek and Sundry-- yes, thank you very much, I am indeed a very cool person. I've been with Geek and Sundry for about eight months now, it was really intimidating at first because I kept mixing up Vax and Vex. Yeah, I still mix up Vax and Vex. But okay, what I was going to say was that Critical Role fans are the warmest, most welcoming fans. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m10s">(cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m59s">Yeah! Except for that guy. Right? But no, I love you guys, give yourselves a big hand, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h0m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m8s">I want you guys to know, this is our first time doing this, this is as I said the first inaugural premiere, they're all synonyms, right? So if you're like me you're extremely excited. But please remember that all the people at home are still watching, say hi to the people at home, hi people at home. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m27s">#</a> <strong>AUDIENCE</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m27s">Hi! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h1m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m28s">#</a> <strong>KEVIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m28s">Right? So please do me a favor, put your phones on silent, all right? The house lights are going to be kind of dim, so you can use your phones, you can tweet, you can do social media posts, whatever you want, if there's a Cubone somewhere please let me know, tweet at me. I need like ten Cubones. So yeah, just put everything on silent and be silent about it. You can tweet about the show, please use the hashtag #CriticalRoleLive, surprisingly enough. Do me another favor, don't do the concert pic thing where you put your phone up and record for ten minutes at a time, because there are people behind you, as you may or may not know, so I'd really appreciate that. The other thing is, this not a Rocky Horror thing, so don't shout out like, I would like to rage. Don't do that stuff, don't "how do you want to do this?" Don't do that stuff. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h1m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m28s">Be respectful of the people on stage. Think of this as a funny play. You can laugh, you can woo, but maybe don't shout out suggestions. Especially the suggestions that I know a lot of you have in your heads, right? Wait, I have one other thing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h1m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m28s">There's a merch thing. The merch table's going to be open after the show, is that right? Yes. After the show, the merch table's going to be open, so if you didn't get a chance to get merch, you're going to get another chance to get merch, so don't worry about that. Is there something else? VIPs will get your posters after, so if you're a VIP, you'll get a poster, just come-- where? Upstairs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h1m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m28s">Okay. Don't worry. Right. Thank you. Let's hear it for Claudia once again, guys. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h1m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h14m35s">So. Our intrepid band of adventurers, Vox Machina, found themselves recently traversing the Feywild in search of another Vestige of Divergence. In doing so, they managed to find an old friend in the nymph Nahla, acquired some information, trading a book, and found their way towards the ever-shifting grasses northward in search of where the Divergence, the object of the Divergence lies. In doing so, they found a new ally, a new friend. A little satyr by the name of, where is it here-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h14m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h15m5s">Garmelie, thank you. Now Garmelie, who had made some really interesting sketches of the party upon being caught was then dragged into Scanlan's magnificent mansion, at which Pike asked him to make a fantastic mural for the interior of that place, which I think still resides there to this day. And on the internet, as we've discovered. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h15m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h15m5s">Upon traveling further north, hopefully to find their final destination in the form of the Shademirk Bog, where the Fenthras bow seemingly exists, you instead came upon Syngorn, the city from the youthful days of Vex and Vax. Upon speaking to the head-- pardon me; you see, all the nerves gets the belching out. It works out well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h15m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h15m5s">So, as you guys walk through the beautiful verdant city, tall seemingly endless trees around you, many buildings naturally formed and built from smoothly carved stone, various ancient <i>sigils</i> carved throughout the entire cityscape, the very heavy-armored Verdant Guard gathered in places, and a general air of intensity and building military might within the city of Syngorn, you have your invisible companion Garmelie, who at some point in the near future agreed to tell you what it is he wishes you to steal for him as part of the deal that was made by the twins. So. What would you like to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h15m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And then it eventually rises up into a somewhat spherical building, and there are many that build off of that to create this kind of neighborhood of various elven abodes within Syngorn. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h21m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

While your family is not a political house per se, your father, as an ambassador to Emon, was given a home in this location. It is your old home, although it appears to have been even further renovated and is much nicer than you remember, but the door is closed and the dusk sun leads you to pause as you look upon the outside of this abode you have not seen in many, many years. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=0h22m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You recognize her as Devana, the new wife of Syldor, the one that you had once met before in Emon when you guys came upon your father last time.

You guys have not actually been inside this palace before; you've only seen it from a distance, as your father would not let you in too close to the center of the city. As you make your way up the stairs, you can see guards, the Verdant Guards step out in an aggressive and defensive way, but the guards to your sides immediately put their hands up and signal them to put their arms down and to stand at ease. You guys are brought to the front, the doors open, and a small elderly elvish gentleman comes out, his long white hair almost touching the ground as he shuffles up. He brings a small monocle up to the side of his face. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=1h26m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h27m19s">You all follow suit and are led through the main entryway to the palace itself. On the inside you can see these giant archways that the pillars that hold them up look like trees that spread to the top like the stone boughs actually hold a canopy made of marble with beautiful portraits and long artistic renditions of the creation of Syngorn, the people, each bloodline that has progressed and taken on the central political structure of the city. As it goes, you can see busts of people who have been of historical importance to Syngorn, and eventually you're brought to the very end of this hallway. Amongst a series of other offshoot hallways and doors, there is the next portion of this journey, this large central chamber. The door is already partially ajar. You are led into what seems to be the equivalent of a throne room, but it appears that there is a half-circle table in the center of the room and a series of chairs that now sit empty across from one side. Your side. The other side of the table, you see sitting quietly and patiently, an older elven woman, you can see the grey in her hair and the crow's-nests at the corner of her eyes, which in elven years means she's quite old, she's probably close to 150 or 200 years old, by your gathering. They can live quite a long time. She would be in the equivalent of her late 50s. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=1h27m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

He pulls out a keyring, goes, "No, not that one. Ah, here we are." It opens up into a small room, you can see in here, it's a display room. In here you can see ornamental armor and helmets and all sorts of classic Syngorean designs, which change often because, well, elves when they don't have a lot of things to fill their time with, it's all about designing new outfits and new armor. There's a whole display of very classic designs for the guards, for the watchers, for the people who first founded Syngorn. It's like a history walk through. But there is a section that is primarily helmet designs for different stations and, "This is as close to a hat "room as we have. This here is part of the original Temple of Ioun design.

It's at this point that your mind hits that these are probably offerings, these are things that are left as some sort of offering to this bear-like spirit entity that exists in this cave. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=2h34m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And Trinket is so tiny by comparison and is up to the elbow, but Trinket lashes out at the giant bear, just leaps up towards it, pushes into it and starts tearing at its throat. The giant bear takes Trinket with one claw and slams him into the ground. Trinket rolls and gets back up, (growls), you can see a little bit of blood at the corner of its mouth, and just lunges again, this time jumping up onto the bear's back and clawing up onto its, onto the top of its torso.

<dd id="l2h38m18s">The bear head looks up at Trinket now gnawing onto its hide, (gnawing sounds), seemingly to no real effect, and the bear reaches up and grabs Trinket and plucks him off the side and sets him down next to you. The bear now begins to speak in the language of bears, which only you can understand at this moment, says, "You walk with this one. Is she your charge?" And Trinket voices back, you hear the (bear noises) up to the bear, as you hear coming out, "She is everything. Her "life is mine. You take her, you take me, or we walk on and remember you as a kind soul." The giant bear looks down, "Very well. If you are at her side, I take your charge, as well." And the spirit bear steps forward, passing through you, and passing through Trinket's form, and what feels like this rush of warm air. And then disperses into a series of sparkles. You watch the energy slowly drift down and fade into the ground around you, and everything gets quiet. The trees slowly creak back and open the perimeter of this forest around you, leaving you alone. And Trinket comes up and licks your face. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=2h38m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h40m42s">And has an ability called Primal Fury you can use once per short rest that I'll get to next episode. As you all gather around this moment of silence, this quiet tension that has now dispersed, you see Trinket lift up Vex from the base of her cloak and put her back on her feet, nuzzles the side of her, and you can see the trees overhead open up a little wider than they were before, leaving some moonlight to hit the two of them. And that's where we'll go ahead and leave this session this week. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Ok4ZW9cNupc&t=2h40m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
