<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Hate you, Liam. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">(laughter) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m10s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m10s">That was good! Really nice. Some good flavor on it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m13s">You'll never know. So anyway! Welcome new folks. People who aren't new folks, welcome back. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h0m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m13s">We have some announcements to get to real fast, then we'll jump into the actual story proper here. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h0m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m13s">But, yeah! So, first and foremost, I wanted to give a big thanks and shout-out to Syrinscape, I mentioned them in last week's game, I put together my gaming playlists on their platform, and I'm going to be trying them out tonight to make sure everything works out cool, but their setup is fantastic and I'm really excited about being able to overlap audio, and things fade in and out. If you haven't checked it out, and you want to really amp up your tabletop gaming, it's phenomenal. But they're not paying for this, I'm really excited about it. So that's that, Syrinscape's awesome. Marisha, you want to talk about Signal Boost? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h0m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m35s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m35s">And I tell you about cool things that I like. That I picked out myself. My favorite things. Done. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h1m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m42s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m42s">Watch it. It's good. All right. Next thing I wanted to announce for you guys, tonight's donations, and all donations for the week, are going to be going, as opposed to 826 overall, are going to go to 826Seattle specifically, to Fearless Ideas, is what it's called there, their section up there, you can go to FearlessIdeas.org. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h1m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m42s">This past week there was a terrible gas explosion in Seattle, you may have seen on the news, and it did a lot of damage to that vicinity, including Fearless Ideas, and they've had to cancel a bunch of their stuff, and they're trying to get things repaired and going. So all of our donations this evening will be going towards them and helping them get that effort taken care of. So think good thoughts and help out if you can. Let's see. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h1m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m22s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS, MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h2m37s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m37s">Wait, are we supposed to be at that? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h2m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m39s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m39s">Next Friday. Next Friday. But most of us will be there for that panel. We'll be doing a Q&amp;A, answering questions, talking about the show, for all the folks that are local or coming to that convention in the Anaheim area of southern California. So, look forward to seeing you there, next Friday. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h2m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m7s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m7s">Wanted to give another shout-out to Dwarven Forge again, I mentioned them last week. You got to get a glimpse of some of the map stuff they gave us here at Critical Role to help improve our battle mats and scenarios on occasion. Their new Castle Builder Kickstarter is phenomenal, and if you're looking to do big structures and cool castle-based ramparts and parapets and everything, go check it out, it might be right up your alley. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h3m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m38s">(cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h3m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m50s">And I've been so excited about this shirt coming out, I can't wait to wear it, why aren't we wearing it right now? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h3m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m55s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m55s">(Gilmore voice) "Don't worry. Trust me, it's a fabulous shirt. Some would even say it's quite "glorious." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h3m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m1s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m3s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m3s">As well as the Gilmore's Glorious Goods t-shirts, we also have exclusive Critical Role d20 rings, spinny rings. Those are limited, so if you get them, then snag them fast, because they're going to be gone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m13s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m13s">We get one of those before they disappear, right? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m15s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m15s">I think they said they were going to set us aside some, they'd better. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m17s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m17s">They are. They're bitchin'. You spin it, the 20 is the Critical Role logo. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m22s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m30s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m30s">For those who don't know what those are, the d20 spin rings, or spin rings in general, they're actually two separate moving pieces with ball bearings on the inside, and you have all numbers one through 20 on the actual ring, and you can spin it with your finger, and it acts like a die roll! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m44s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m44s">And the d20, when you crit succeed, it's a Critical Role logo. Just putting that out there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m49s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m49s">You can do all your life decisions based off a ring. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m51s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m51s">What could possibly go wrong? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m53s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m53s">You still can die from them, though, just to be clear. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m55s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m56s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m56s">And we are not held responsible if that happens. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h4m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m59s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m1s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m1s">It's appropriately called a "die." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h5m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m6s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m15s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m15s">Sure, I could talk about a couple of things. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h5m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m15s">Hey, a quick shout-out for our neighbor, Ivan van Norman's Kickstarter, The ABCs of RPGs, has three days left. I backed it immediately, because I like D&amp;D and I have kids, and you put those two things together and good things happen. So that's good, three days left. Also, hey, if you like to put your dice in boxes, I tell you what. Wyrmwood Gaming make beautiful boxes, and if you go over to their site and you use the code critrole. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h5m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m43s">There it is. You get free shipping, they're beautiful, they have all different kinds of woods to put your dice inside. Is there anything else? Oh, yeah! Oh, okay. Yeah, hey, some of us, not all of us, are going to be going up to San Fran later this month to make appearances on GameSpot's show The Lobby for a couple of segments, and then, also then hopping over to hang with the guys at Kinda Funny to play D&amp;D. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h5m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m15s">Which, a few of us will be running a quick little one-shot game I'll be running with the aid of one of their local gentlemen. And it should be a ridiculously ridiculous time! And it'll be a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h6m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m27s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h8m50s">So. Where we left off. The party of Vox Machina, having to deal with the current terrible danger of the Chroma Conclave, a collection of very dangerous dragons that have torn through the entire Tal'Dorei countryside, have then gone on this quest to collect allies, and find these items called the Vestiges of Divergence, these artifacts of ancient wars that carry great power and seem to be the best way you could prepare yourselves for going up against these terrifyingly powerful entities. In searching for this, you went and made your way to Vasselheim, where you reacquired and reestablished friendships with Zahra and Kashaw, two allies from previous instalments of our wondrous adventure, as well as getting Lady Kima on loan from the Platinum Sanctuary of Bahamut, and you all went to seek the first bit of information you discovered about one of these vestiges, not too far from Vasselheim. The champion of the Raven Queen's armor that had been entombed within this temple that had sunken beneath a lake. After traveling to this lake, finding your way through this subterranean, watery location, you found the location of the tomb, upon which, a series of fish creatures, called kuo-toa, had seemingly been worshiping another denizen of this temple, a rather strange slime-covered beholder, that then surprised the party. The battle hard-fought, you came out victorious, and upon going to retrieve your spoils, a trap was set off in the tomb, dodged by one, survived by a bear, and claimed the life of our beloved Vex'ahlia. After a resurrection ritual attempted by Kashaw, the party helping, they were successful in bringing her soul back from the other side, restoring her to life, and the party then, figuring out what their next step in their journey was, took their new allies, via Keyleth's Teleportation via Plants spell, back to Whitestone, which seems to be building as this defensive bastion, this currently not on the radar of the Conclave location that needs defenses, and a good place to keep your allies at the time. And that was where we left off, as you guys had just stepped back into Whitestone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h8m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h40m13s">And from Westruun you can see most of the city, as you recall, and a large portion of it currently looks toppled-over and pushed into ruin. There are no longer burning black clouds, but white smoke, long after a fire or some sort of an impact, lazily drifting off some of those ruins. It focuses even closer, and you see very little populace in the streets. Most everyone's either indoors or not visible at the moment. Your vision clicks in once again, and you can see currently some sort of dark room hidden in Westruun. You see, for a brief instant, a flicker of light, and you see Drake Thunderbrand and Allura both gathering a few small books under their arms, silently waiting, quietly. You hear (impact sounds) some heavy footfalls above. They both just stay quiet, stay quiet. Allura stays still for a moment. She looks over at Drake. They both take hands and then (whoosh) convert into that same energy form you saw that jettisoned out of Greyskull Keep, that echoes down a long hallway that you previously didn't see was attached to this room. It leads to a stone spiral staircase that goes upward before these two dual sparks travel through the small crack between where the edge of a trap door and a wooden floor is as the sparks course upward into the now-setting sun. You can see amongst the sparks the mostly collapsed rubble of the Cobalt Reserve, the large library in the center of Westruun. You can see dozens of corpses that have been largely dissolved. You can see what remnants of their bodies have been eaten away by some sort of caustic material, their arms and fingers tightened up as the muscles pull into this horrible, gnarled visage of what once were the living residents of Westruun. You do see, as the spark comes to a stop for a second in its movement, and you hear briefly overhead (wingbeats) and you see rush overhead, wings fully spread, the black dragon that you had briefly encountered in Emon streak upward, roaring loudly, towards Gatshadow, the tall, dark spire mountain just north of Westruun. (whoosh) And as it heads up there, the sparks (electric sound) continue their trek through the streets, and at that point the ritual fades, its vision unable to maintain its focus. Your vision is pulled back up into the clouds and then thrust back into your current position and with a shock you find yourself back in the tavern. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=0h40m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h33m53s">Keyleth steps forward, touches her hand to the Sun Tree, completes her mental incantation, and you watch the trunk once again tear open into the somewhat oval walkway into the tree itself. On the opposite side, what's your destination? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=2h33m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l2h34m15s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l2h34m15s">Okay. You recall, passing through, there were a number of trees towards the base of the mountain that were starting to grow petrified from the proximity to the ash that constantly falls from the sky. They died a long time ago and are slowly beginning to petrify. As the portal opens up on the opposite side, you can see beyond that the dark rock that formulates that mountain range. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=2h34m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h34m15s">At the same time, you can see a dull orange glow, and you all begin to step through in rapid succession, Trinket racing up after Vex. All of you find yourself stepping out the other side, at which point you look up and you can see the pathway that you took towards the top of the mountain where the Fire Ashari called Pyrah, where they maintained their ever-vigilant watch on the tear into the fire elemental plane. What you do notice immediately is that the path that you took initially is no longer a simple walkway. Against the now very dark sky, this side of the realm itself, night is, actually, no, sorry. At this point, you've actually beaten the sun. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=2h34m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l2h35m42s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l2h35m42s">So it's still light in the sky from other parts in the distance, however, there is a perpetual dark cloud of smoke and actual storm cloud gathering across this mountain range. As you recall the first time you were here, that's the nature of Pyrah, it's always under this thick, heavy, soot-and-ash-filled cloud cover. The pathway that winds up the mountain, though, is instead a glowing orange mass of slowly dribbling molten rock that has filled that entire walkway, and it has come to rest at the base of the mountain where it has gathered and begun to cool. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=2h35m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h35m42s">You guys are hundreds of feet off from this point as you step out of the tree. However, where you see the molten rock has reached the base of the mountain, you-- it's cooled and formed into solid rock at its base, and you start seeing flashes of the orange turning dark, then another section turns dark from the opposite side. And then a few moments pass and you can see the orange of the next section, up in like ten-foot segments, it's going dark and hardening on its own. You get the sense that your arrival did not trigger this more than it has been happening since before you arrived. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=2h35m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You can see bits and pieces of the various petrified trees thrown hundreds of feet from the center. There are still standing, defiant trees amongst what once was the Cindergrove, but they are very sparse, many of them now blackened by what you can see in the very distance beyond the broken huts and homes that once held the Pyrah, you can see in the distance moving, glowing dots of various elemental energies spiraling outward from a very large central red rift that sits there pulsing and pulsing with bright, almost sunlight energy. It's like staring into the sun at the very zenith of its movement. You have to avert your eyes even staring towards this rift, now a good 30, 40 feet taller than it was when you last returned here. What was once the portal in the ground has now ruptured and is emerging, slowly piercing out of the top of this mountain. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=2h53m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h58m43s">All right. As the cluster of you begin stepping deeper into the caldera, you begin to approach the outskirts of the remnants of the Pyrah tribe's homestead. You can see where most of it has been either completely burnt to a cinder or lies tattered by some great force, shattered. And you start, as you're walking through, you can see where the landscape itself, all the jagged bits of black obsidian glass are shooting up out of the ground and there's broken pieces of the dark rock and volcanic material, and it isn't until your eyes begin to focus that you realize that elements of this rock is not rock at all but the twisted and charred remains of the Pyrah that didn't escape in time, blending in with the ground and landscape surrounding. The rest of the Ashari continue pushing forward, not taking notice, focused, as before you, you can see the rift, still blinking ever-bright, in the center of the remains of the Cindergrove. You steel yourselves. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0uazTyTrk-8&t=2h58m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
