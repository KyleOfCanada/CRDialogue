<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's pseudo-episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy voice actors will be answering your questions and then doing a fantastic battle royale showdown between Pike, Vax, Keyleth, and Percy. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m13s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m13s">Woo-hoo! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h0m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m15s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m15s">For those of you who were here for our last battle royale, it's going to be a fun circumstance where the players are dropped into a scenario they do not yet know. They'll be forced to battle with only one victor, the last man standing. But we'll get into that for the second half of this evening. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h0m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m15s">First, let's get through some quick announcements. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h0m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m15s">If we want to get through those, I probably should have loaded them up on my phone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h0m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m32s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m43s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m43s">I have a quick announcement. Those who haven't seen or had an opportunity to play yet, this week had the launch of Overwatch, Blizzard's new game. I'm lucky enough to play the character McCree, the space cowboy. You guys get to have an opportunity to shoot a six-shooter in the game and tell people (McCree voice), "It's high noon." If you haven't played it, you should, it's a lot of fun. I have enjoyed the <i>crap</i> out of it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h3m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m10s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m13s">I get tweeted pretty much at every time zone's noon. Every day, people barrage me with, "Hey Matt, what time is it?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h4m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m22s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m29s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m31s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m31s">And not to be confused with MacCready. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h4m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m41s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m41s">No, apparently any gun-slinging guys with McCree in their name have been me this past year. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h4m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m47s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m47s">Yeah, you got the cornerstone. McCree, MacCready, and then what is the name of your character in Evolve, which is also a cyber space cowboy? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h4m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m56s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m56s">Space cowboy, that's Abe. (Abe voice) Abraham Presley. Yeah, guys in hats with guns has been a theme this past year, some of them with really great facial hair. I love that theme. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h4m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m7s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m13s">We're going to have to sync up and play it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h5m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m15s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m15s">It's going to be a thing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h5m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m17s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m17s">Anyway! We've got questions to get to. So, first and foremost, we have a few sources of questions. Obviously we're not going to get to a lot of them tonight, because there's a lot of questions. But there's a Reddit thread that's been up for a little while, we're going to be pulling questions from there. The chat room as well, we have at our side here. We have questions coming from you guys there as long as we can keep track of it because it goes pretty fast. Is my mic bad, not getting a good mic? I'll lean this way then and try and get to this section. Should work fine. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h5m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m51s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m51s">You could adjust the boom. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h5m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m53s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m53s">Yeah, but the camera is there. Karen? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h5m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m57s">#</a> <strong>KAREN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m57s">You're very audible. They're just being picky. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h5m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m0s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m0s">Just being picky? Guys, stop being picky. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h6m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m0s">It's all good. So long as you guys can hear me, I think we're okay. Yeah, we have Reddit, we have the chat room, and then we have on Twitter the hashtag Critical Role questions as well. We'll be going through those and picking questions, answering them as they come. So, let us begin. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h6m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m0s">We're apologizing now for all of us looking at our phones. It's not because we're bored, it's because we want to answer your questions. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h6m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m27s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m27s">That's where the questions are. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h6m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m32s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m32s">This comes from Groghammer on Reddit. "After the episode 'Cows and Consequences', Matt said it "was one of the weirdest, but not the weirdest, D&amp;D experience he's ever had. To him and others with "experience, what is the weirdest thing that's happened in a game you've played?" This is an interesting question. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h6m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m51s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m51s">Offscreen, I guess? Outside of 'Cows and Consequences'? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h6m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m55s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m55s">It could be something in Critical Role if you want to, but if you had other stranger experiences. I'll begin. This was weird but dark. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h6m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m55s">This was when I was running the Ravenloft game for a few years with my old group back in the late 2000s. As they began to make their way through Barovia, the atmosphere of it was drawing them down and every night they'd sleep there, they would take corruption similarly to how you did when you were in Whitestone under the watch of the Briarwoods. We had our bard begin to grow sharpened teeth. We had our rogue character, who had a long-dormant mummy rot that had been subsiding in his body begin to spread again. We had our blood mage, who had died and been resurrected, came back not quite right and went a little feral. And then we had our paladin, whose skin all of a sudden was pulled tighter against his body, and as a person whose whole ideal was to fight undead, to look in the mirror one day and see that he resembled one, he went crazy and started smashing stuff. It was a cool buildup, but one of the weirder, fun experiences was when they had finally finished the battle with Strahd, when they had defeated him and, in theory, saved Ravenloft, the epilogue ended up being a "at what "cost?" circumstance. Well, the cleric died in the final battle, the paladin killed himself, the blood mage disappeared into the forest and was never seen again. The rogue, who was like the older Indiana Jones character of the group, took the castle for himself and became the new lord of Barovia, Batman-style, supposedly to watch over the city, but his corruption had gotten so heavy that it wasn't sure if they were replacing one monster with another. And the bard, who had had a constant feud with the rogue, got, in the final moments of the game, in a huge argument post-battle, and the rogue grabbed him and tore his tongue out. And the bard now served him as this mute, subservient Gollum figure and was at the edge of his throne in the epilogue as the rogue took the throne of Barovia for himself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h6m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>

None of you had to tell me about that, that's what I was thinking about. And if that hadn't happened, I probably would have done more than punch him one time. I probably would have went a little bit further. But I would say, on one hand, Vax thinks it's a little different because Vax rushed in to try to save his sister, not exactly the same situation. But on the other hand, you're kind of right, he doesn't have any moral high ground, and I'm not trying to play anyone on moral high ground. And I thought, do I have the right to do this?

And his evil cleric had set up, for half the game, a plot to eventually to kill the rest of the party and take them for power, but only the DM knew.

So I allowed it for that circumstance. Most of the time, yes, they would be shunted out, and if you'd rolled a lower intelligence roll, you probably would have been pushed out the side. But as a Dungeon Master, you have to justify things, consider what makes sense versus what doesn't, how much do the mechanics written in the rules rule your game in the narrative, and how much you want to allow because the players have been creative or it's an interesting way that could make sense and you can justify. I chose in that moment to justify that, and it didn't necessarily work in their favor in some ways, but that's the nature of making weird, cool plans and seeing if they come to fruition or not. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h26m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Once it did get free, you saw how fast it could turn in a negative position for a group. And the chains were good. It sacrificed damage, but it also raised the DC of its ability to escape from the grapple that was holding it on the ground. You guys did a really good job and had some rolls going in your favor, but once it started turning over and it escaped, it went south very quick. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h32m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h37m59s">I'd say an interesting mix for Percy of self-loathing, which is definitely a big thing for him too, and the unbridled belief that his parents put into him that he's the only adult in the room. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h37m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

For the backstory, I was a thief for years. I did shitty things and stole from people so he could get by. I think he at this point in life feels like he's been a fuck-up and a waste of time most of his life, and the only good thing he's had in his whole life is his relationship with his sister, which is like one, good, true thing.

Yeah, I don't know. She's got some weird stuff with her family, which we haven't really gotten into, because she comes from the deep gnomes. They're a little bit of tricksters.

We had conversations about D&amp;D back when we began our campaign, and he kept asking about it, and I could see that twinkle in his eye of interest, and I was like, "Well, we have a guest spot coming up. Would you be "interested in playing?" He was like, "I have no idea what I'm doing. Sure." And so we got together at the Coral Cafe, and we built a character, went over the rules a bit, and he's like, "I still "don't know what I'm doing, but sure."

Whenever you bring me an idea, it would be like trying to marry what you're trying to accomplish versus what would be viable within the game, and finding balance as it is, but an aspect of your class features. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=0h55m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h0m38s">I'll answer another quick Vaxleth question, which is, what inspired it? I think that all during the home game, and even at the beginning of the game on the show, Vax had the same opinion of Keyleth as his sister, which was, "Come on. Are you serious?" most of the time. "Goody two-shoes? "Really?" I don't remember what it was, I promise I don't remember what it was, but something happened in one game. I remember thinking about it after the show and then talking to Matt in the next day or two, going like, "Can you do this in Dungeons &amp; Dragons? Like, would this be okay? Would you be "okay with it? I'm not going to go anywhere with it, but would that be okay?" That's where it came from. And the reason I thought it would be fun for the game is the same reason I think why Taliesin had Percy give Grog an evil, sentient sword. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h0m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h0m38s">Because it would make the game interesting. It would totally shift the game pieces on the board and add new dynamics in unpredictable ways. I'm not treating it like a dating sim where the end result for me playing D&amp;D was "winning the "princess". It's just to see how things could change in the next year of gameplay. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h0m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h2m22s">Question from AaronShot on Reddit, saying, "Matt, give us a little tease. When you talked "about illegal substances being on the market in Emon during one of the Q&amp;As at a con last year, "how much world-building have you done to date that we have not seen yet? Wildemount, Marquet." As much as I can. It's a progressive thing I'm developing and have been for years. Free time has not been copious. This show is a fantastic thing every week that takes up a lot of my free time. We have a lot of cool things we have coming up that we want to hopefully announce that take a lot of my free time. This is one thing that I'm always working on. I have fleshed out a good portion of Marquet. I've fleshed out elements of Wildemount. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h2m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h2m22s">It's not as fleshed out as others. Othanzia and Tal'Dorei are the two most fleshed out in my world, because those are the two where you guys have spent your most time. Whenever this game's done, we start a new campaign, it'll probably still be in Exandria, but it might start in Marquet. It might start somewhere else in the world and have a whole different cultural flavor and flair, and it'll be a whole different side to this world. And there'll be references to and history that exists that you would know, because you were part of it before, but you'll be a whole new group of adventurers in a whole different part of the world. That'll be fun. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h2m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h5m57s">(laughs) It says, "Gilmore started out as kind of a caricature and was a fleshed-out "character--" Question went away, but Gilmore didn't start out as a caricature in my head. I never want to make an NPC a caricature per se. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h5m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h5m57s">There are characters that have strong personality traits and they emerge themselves, because for an NPC, you have to make an impact quickly. You don't have a lot of time with them, and you want to try and make the world lively and interesting for your players. So I have certain personality points that are at the forefront of each personality. Gilmore to me was never a caricature, partially because I built him around somebody I used to do theater with when I was younger in high school, so I already had a personality print for him. But also I really wanted to show a character that could be ostentatious and flamboyant in a way that was fun and not a caricature. If that didn't come across, my apologies. Gilmore is a very charismatic, very outgoing salesman, and that's part of his job. He uses that to his advantage. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h5m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h7m52s">He's also been one of the greatest pleasures for me for this game, because it wasn't anything that I saw coming. It was really funny and surprising the first time at home, and then he came back several times, and right from the first time that Gilmore appeared, he zeroed in on Vax and was sweet on Vax. It was nervous laughter the first time, and then slowly over time it got more charming, and more charming, up to the point where you guys have seen that probably Vax is legitimately taken with him, definitely intrigued by him. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h7m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h8m21s">Gilmore's a great character, and Vax was definitely taken with him. We probably saw Gilmore two to three weeks of the last three years? Maybe more?

<dd id="l1h8m56s">I will say on that fact, too, because someone asked this question, and they said there have been hints on the characters that have exhibited LGBT relationships in the game, but a lot of characters seem to be husband-and-wife-type personalities. Are those only a small number of people, and I'm like, no. I don't make a big deal of sexuality in the game unless it comes up, because I don't think it's something that should drive the story, it just exists in the world. I think there's relationships of all kinds in Exandria. And I think culturally, just like in the real world, some places it's more appropriate than not, based on wherever they live. It doesn't mean I agree with that, by any means. I believe love is love no matter where you find it. And there are places in Exandria where it is more acceptable than others. And that's a whole different story element that might come up depending on where you travel in the world, I don't know. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h8m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h9m52s">But yeah. Like many writers, I err on the side of creating an interesting character who might happen to be gay. Or an interesting character that may happen to be bisexual. I try not to make that a defining characteristic of the personality, nor do I want to try and go out of my way to have a one-off NPC that you encounter be like, "Oh, by the way, I have a wife and I'm a "girl." Because that to me seems like it's forced, it's shoehorned and now it's not about the story, it's about that relationship, whereas if the relationship were to come about as part of the story then that's just how it is, because that's life. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h9m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l1h11m20s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h11m20s">Oh, College of the Maestro. Yeah, I put up a College of the Maestro bard college on DMs Guild recently, and that came from a character-- I may have mentioned it in previous Q&amp;As. I've never played a bard, but I've always wanted to. I love bard classes, I love the aspect behind them. They were really underappreciated in previous editions, but I loved the idea of a guy who knows a little bit about everything and is an inspiration to the party around him, and so I had this character concept for a long time to make a bard-- probably a dwarven bard, because I love dwarves also-- who, as opposed to playing music or singing music, could pluck the sound from the air around them. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h11m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m20s">The sound of battle. The impact of a sword against a shield, or the sound of a creature chittering as it attacks, and mold it into a symphony, almost like a soundbender where they pull and turn it into music, and that was their basis. So instead of fighting with a weapon, they have a wand and an open hand, and they stand in the middle or the back of the battlefield and conduct it, like an orchestra conductor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h11m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h12m22s">Eventually I got really frustrated and was like, "I'm going to make this as a bard college "and we'll see if people like it." It's gotten a good response. It's still being tweaked. Anything homebrew you try and balance it as best you can. At first blast, I don't have a lot of time to really finetune it, and I wanted to get it out there to get the community response, and it's been really great. You guys have had great feedback and I'm tweaking things as we go, so there'll probably be a couple more updates in the next few weeks or months. So thank you all, people who have reached out and given comments on DMs Guild or on the Reddit thread. It's making its way towards hopefully being a fun option for those who want to try it out.

<dt><a href="#l1h15m56s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h15m56s">My suggestion is, consider, if your character is a murderhobo, there are ramifications for that type of action in a society. You as a DM, it's your responsibility to keep in mind, there probably-- unless they're in some sort of destitute place where that's totally fine-- there are going to be guards. There are going to be sentinels. There are going to be people that their job is to stop murderhobos from coming in and being murderhobos. So they will become wanted. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h15m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h15m56s">They will become hunted. There's a possibility there might be a bounty put on their heads, from individuals that are more powerful than the party. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h15m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h15m56s">And if they're going to be real dicks about it and not try and play the story you've created, and want to murder everyone, they're probably going to end up shot to death in an alley with a bunch of crossbow bolts and that's the end of their game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h15m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h15m56s">That's a valuable lesson to learn. If it's a world which enables a murderhobo-type circumstance, that's different, and you can find narratives in there, but it's definitely more of an evil campaign, and a little harder to run unless you have some experience as a GM. But if it's something you don't want to happen in the game, keep in mind, there are ramifications for such horrible, murderous actions, which could lead to a really interesting story. Perhaps they killed a few people and they all of a sudden meet the families of these individuals, or the person that captures them is related to someone they murdered, and decides no, I'm not going to execute you, I'm going to make you work for me until you realize what you've done. Or perhaps a paladin or a cleric that actually feels sorry for them is like, "You did a horrible thing, but I don't understand why "you did this. I want to understand it. Until then, you're under my watch." Now they're working for this individual who is trying to understand how you were so corrupted as people. You can find different ways to turn that behavior into part of the story. But if it's just the players trolling you, maybe have a talk with your party to work with you and respect the time you've put into the game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h15m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h21m21s">Oh! We have Zoaga on Reddit asks: "Quick question for Matt: As we've seen, you've tinkered "with the stats of the ancient dragons in the Conclave. Without going into specific details, do "you have any idea what kind of challenge rating these modifications might put them at?" I don't. I try and measure it, but a lot of the measurements are based on parties of four, maybe five. We have a party of seven, sometimes eight people when we have guests on, and because of the nature of us coming from Pathfinder to this game, and I tend to run games a little higher-power than the average, I've had to adjust a lot of the difficulty in the game, which has been an interesting challenge for me as a DM, but also means that the scale is going to continue to get more epic. I have to tweak it, because we have a lot of powerful characters with powerful items, but that's the kind of game I wanted to run anyway. The next game might be a little more low-powered depending on where it starts. We shall see. I've learned a lot. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h21m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h21m21s">Remember, I came into this -- we went from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition when we started the stream, really our first time playing Fifth Edition, so there's been balancing lessons learned as we progress, and a lot of circumstances that caught me and the players off-guard as far as difficulty. That's part of the fun of the game. So for me, it's learning through experience, previous encounters, learning the players' strengths and weaknesses, and finding ways to tweak creatures that better fit those to be a real challenge when it has to be and to not be a real challenge when it doesn't have to be. Not every battle has to be a fight to the death, to the teeth ever, because sometimes fights are enjoyable for players to show up and fight basilisks that once tore them asunder and be like, oh, we come back and we tear you down! It's fun to have those quick victories sometimes. But yeah, you have to find it through practice, and the DMG scaling does help a lot, but on this level, this size of a party with what they have at their disposal, I kind of have to wing a lot of it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h21m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h32m43s">No, I can't say I have any regrets as a DM story-wise because I let you guys guide so much of it. I build stuff and let it happen and I'm usually happy with things, how they turn out, whether or not I planned on it or not. That to me is what's fascinating and interesting and fun as a DM is being caught off-guard and having to justify and work with it on a constant improv level. I may have regrets mechanically. I might forget elements in battle or might be circumstances that happen. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h32m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h32m43s">For instance, when Gilmore came in and gave you guys the Heroes' Feast, not thinking at the time, it set you up for a battle with a purple worm and essentially disabled its most dangerous element: its tail poison. I didn't realize it at the time because it just organically happened. But I'm not going to try and hold that back or restrain it in the moment. It happened to work out to be in your favor, and that's how it works sometimes. I just let it happen. So I wouldn't say I really have any regrets. Not because I'm too good for them, just because I let things happen, and I appreciate it for the good and the bad that comes with it and let the story guide itself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=1h32m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you pull back suddenly, this smoldering, smoky ruin that was once Keyleth begins to slowly melt away against the tide of lava. The pouring rock halts in place as a voice goes, "And... I "have my victor!" Suddenly, the lava right behind you tears open, and you find yourself falling, plummeting into darkness, and the plummeting turns into just falling and falling, then light begins to fill the space beneath you, and you look down as a small platform of marble approaches you. You think you're about to crash into it at full terminal velocity. Instead, your feet gingerly touch, and you come to stand there. The same strange, white-clad, jheri curl-haired gentleman walks up to you and goes, "Well played!" and high-fives you. "I'll send you on back.

<dt><a href="#l4h27m47s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h27m47s">Yeah, that would be the longest fight ever. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h27m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h27m49s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h27m49s">No. You have to understand, you guys had a lot of stand-away characters in this. Throwing Grog in the mix changes everything very quickly. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h27m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h27m49s">He can move quickly and tear your face off quickly. And having Vex over there, who does a shit-ton of damage from a distance. And Sam of course being Sam. Having all of you guys in one arena, fighting? I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be a real crazy fight when it happens. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h27m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h28m17s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h28m17s">Sam would be tough to square off against. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h28m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h28m17s">He'd be another one to get me down to the wire. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h28m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h28m23s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h28m23s">And he's got War Caster, so he gets advantage on his concentration checks, too. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h28m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h28m30s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h28m30s">It's tough, too, because a lot of it comes down to order, after a while. It comes down to turn order. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h28m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h28m37s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h28m37s">Shit, I always forget that I have advantages on charisma saving throws. Advantage on all intelligence, wisdom, and charisma saving throws. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h28m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h28m47s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h28m47s">I know that your strength is artificially increased. Does that artificially increase your skill sets, too? So actually, technically, your athletics should be four. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h28m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h29m1s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h29m1s">Oh, shit, so I probably would have rolled a little higher on some of these. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h29m4s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h29m4s">It's fine. You still succeeded. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h29m6s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h29m6s">It all balances out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h29m9s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h29m9s">Everyone's saying "Happy Birthday, Liam and Laura!" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h29m11s">#</a> <strong>ALL</strong></dt>

<dd id="l4h29m12s">Yeah, they're all wishing you Happy Birthday! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h29m19s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h29m19s">Thank you! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l4h29m20s">If I hear one more "Read Your Spells," people, I am going to murder somebody. No more! No more read your spells or read your sheets. There's a lot to keep track of! This is my binder. Look at all this! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l4h29m37s">You don't have other stuff to deal with, either. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h29m41s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h29m41s">Yeah, it's not like I have three full-time jobs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h29m44s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h29m44s">Nah, it's all good. Well, guys, thank you so much for watching. I hope you had as much fun as we did on this. We'll be back on the actual set, once it'll be finished, next week, for the continuation of the showdown with Umbrasyl and Vox Machina, in which our buddy here, Liam, and Sam are both currently inside the dragon, with Grog dragging behind, and it looks like we may have a guest player next week as well. Also, next Wednesday, I'll be at Meltdown Comics, streaming with Wizards of the Coast, the official Dungeons &amp; Dragons guys, unveiling their new lineup of D&amp;D stuff, and unveiling a new, cool project that I've been kind of developing with them and a few other guests. Ashley, you saw, was announced as one of them. She's playing as our cleric in the group there. We also have Brian Posehn who was announced, the fantastic comedian/actor/writer. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h29m44s">He's going to be there, and we have a few other cool surprise guests that will be announced in the near future. Anyway, that's next Wednesday. Look for the info at the official D&amp;D twitter. Until then, guys, have a wonderful night, rest well, and is it Thursday yet? Goodnight, guys! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4FI8qB-yh-w&t=4h29m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
