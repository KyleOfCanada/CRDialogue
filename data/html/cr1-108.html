People who are Alpha users, we have all the back episodes of Critical Role, all the way up from one to 107 available on Alpha. They retroactively added all the bells and whistles, HP trackers, all that fun stuff, conditions, all the little fun things for the entire show. They just finished it.

<dt><a href="#l0h5m23s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m23s">Yes. So we have Talks Machina at 7:00pm next Tuesday, Pacific. We have Brian Foster, who will be returning for the glory. And then I think that's it. I think that's all of our announcements for the evening. That being the case, let's go ahead and pull ourselves in this evening to tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h5m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m23s">[dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h5m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m15s">Hello and welcome back. Goddamn it. (sighs) Welcome back. I'll remember that. Your dungeon master will remember this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m15s">So. Last we left off, Vox Machina, in trying to find a way to seal off the growing threat of Vecna, now restored to physical form and seeking ascension and achieving it, you've gone to a number of the deities across the Exandria pantheon of the Prime Gods. Gaining some blessings and gaining bits of essence from these deities to create something called a Prime Trammel, an item that was used previously during the Calamity to seal one of the betrayer gods and could possibly put an end to Vecna's newly ascended form and reign as the only god on the Prime Material plane across the Divine Gate. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m15s">Information given to you by the Knowing Mistress sent you beneath an underwater volcano known as Scaldseat, where you proceeded to learn how to breathe water and then step into toxic fume-filled tunnels, where you proceeded to breathe through the water via Grog's jug. Very clever. But finding your way through a short battle with some of the indigenous life forms there, a mother and two children magma bulettes. You headed down deeper into the volcanic caverns of Scaldseat, eventually finding a long-sealed series of chambers by the Allhammer, the deity for craft, family, and legacy, where somewhere supposedly beneath this volcano and hopefully within these long-sealed chambers lies the Core Anvil, where these Prime Trammels can be constructed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m15s">As you made your way through here, hearing the undulating reverberating pounding of some distant piece of machinery, it seemed, heading down the stairs you were put into a hexagonal chamber which had a square of coals and above that, X bars against the wall where in the center you saw a gold inlaid seal, almost. What's the word I'm looking for? An empty triangular shape, a pyramid inverted within this golden seal. And a series of these iron warriors that were embedded in the walls. Behind the stairway, you saw, and you identified upon seeing it, means of smelting metal and other forms of material. When Percival was inspecting one of these warriors, it immediately came to life, and you watched as the glowing outline of each one of these ten-foot-tall, 12-foot-tall metallic warriors glowed bright orange. They each emerged from the walls with these large two-handed greatswords at their side and immediately began to incite conflict. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m15s">And that's where we left off, so to begin this fray: Where are you guys placed, currently? Percival, you would probably be right about where that guy emerged. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h7m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h10m35s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m35s">I would probably be about there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h10m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h10m36s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m36s">You were on the wall. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h10m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h10m37s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m37s">I had my boots on, so I was up by his face. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h10m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h10m40s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m40s">Okay, so we'll put you there. Oh god. Here you go. Grog was by the smelter. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h10m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h10m49s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m49s">I feel like I had been looking at the thing. The big empty pyramid triangle thing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h10m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h10m57s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m57s">So you'd be over in this area. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h10m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h11m12s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h11m18s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h11m31s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m31s">I know that I had just poofed the wings out and I think I was inspecting one of the big metal men before it came out of the wall. I don't really remember which. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h11m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m44s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m44s">Most likely one of the ones that was not attended by another member of the party. So we'll say about here. And Scanlan, whereabouts were you? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h11m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m56s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m56s">You know, near things. Can't really see too well, so put me where-- Let's see. I was at the door when we opened it and then I was beautiful. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m56s">And now I'm not as beautiful. So put me near the door. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h12m16s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m16s">So all of their faces are indented? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h12m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m19s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m19s">Yeah, each one of them, as opposed to the other warriors you saw in the chambers that led down into this area, have no faces. Instead where you see are an empty void triangular like the large seal, but vacuous. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h12m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m30s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h12m38s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

So the flames that were a burning orange-red, extremely hot, begin to flare into bright yellow and white in places. And the heat emanating from it is enough that it causes a lot of you to get uncomfortable in the presence and you have to take a step back, Grog enduring it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h58m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h59m35s">24. So in setting up preparation, you take each one of the heads, and to fill each one of their-- I want to say concave, but it's an interior pyramid space. Convex is outward. It will be about 100 platinum pieces or so to fill each face void. So you take the platinum, you melt it down into the smelter, get it to where it's in the gripped, tong-held metallic reservoir, until it eventually melts down. You then pour it into each of the heads, so 300 platinum utilized to do this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h59m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m35s">It fills to the very edge. Some of it spills over, but you can easily snip that off. As you wait for it to cool, which you can probably help with, actually, as there is no basin for quenching the metal at the moment, so the steam (whoosh) rises up all around, and you turn the heads over, and each one (sliding sound) leaves these heavy metallic pyramid pieces that are smooth and perfect on three of the sides, and one of them appears to be almost like a broken crystal on the inside. It's a shattered, messed-up section. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=0h59m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h14m42s">As the door eventually comes to a stop maybe a foot before it reaches the ceiling, black smoke pours in from the other chamber. You watch as it immediately fills the ceiling and then begins to dissipate up the stairway and the hallway above you where you guys originally descended from. You see flashes of sparks and embers through these clouds of black smoke and soot within the chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h14m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h14m42s">It's obscuring most of your view within the inside. And that heavy pounding, that (pounding) is much louder now.

<dd id="l1h14m42s">You can see small streams of glowing orange molten rock within the chamber, which is slightly down and before you. Looks like two small ten-foot-wide rivers of molten rock, metal-- you can't quite tell from here, but it's glowing orange and red, and they both convene and go dark in the center where it looks like they are being covered or obscured by something that you can't quite make out at this distance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h14m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h16m33s">What you can make out for the most part is this central platform is raised. It looks like there's a staircase that leads up to a middle platform that is in the center of this larger chamber, and it looks to be a couple of large, heavy platforms or pillars that have roaring flames at the edges of them. You can see beneath it, the two pools of lava that disappear beneath it, and you see a hint of a spiral staircase on each side that curls around the back end of where those two rivers of molten rock meet. Behind that, you see the flashes, (sparking) like these rhythmic engines of sparks that are pouring out of the black smoke that is perpetually filling the upper part of this chamber. However, since now it has a place to escape, the room is slowly revealing the interior. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h16m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m33s">You can see on top of this platform in the center a large dark metal object, roughly four or five feet from front to back and about three feet wide of dark, jet black metal, with small veins of glowing red and orange that curl around it that occasionally flare with each impact of whatever this rhythmic metal clanging is behind it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h16m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m33s">As the smoke begins to dissipate even further, more visibility reveals the shape of this object to definitely be that of an anvil. You can see a number of chains that are linked to it on each side that dangle off the edge. You cannot quite see what's at the end of these chains; they're falling off the side of this platform and out of view. You'd have to get closer to see what they are. However, the shape that you now see, right behind this platform, looming at about 20 feet tall from your estimation at this distance, Keyleth, as you are the one who sees this before anybody else does. You see a stocky humanoid form that is looming over the anvil, both of its fists resting on each side of the platform. You can see its trunk-like arms and legs are dark gray stone, and the head carries no face; it is a smooth absence of face. You can see red cables that dangle from the top and the back of the head that are then pulled together in the back like a ponytail, and around the center of its torso and its lower body, these extremely thick layers of leather wrap that make a kilt that dangles past the knees of this giant stone structure that stands there looming over. In one of its hands you see a comparably small but impressive-looking hammer of gold and black that is currently chained to the platform. It's the one that isn't currently dangling off the side. It's in its hand and it's resting there. And you can see the heat emanating from both the pools of molten rocks on the side of it and the flames behind. Most of the imagery is perpetually shifting and being altered by the sheer volume of heat that this chamber holds. This is apparently the Core Anvil, and whatever decor around it looks very intimidating. What do you want to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h16m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

So as you begin to enter the chamber and make your way towards the stairway and this central, raised platform with the two flaming pillars that flank it.

Each flash of light causes this faint glow across your faces and the faces of your companions as their shapes go from dark obscured in the shadow and smoke into a brief reveal of your form. As you begin to approach the stairs, you hear this faint grinding of stone as the faceless giant's head slowly looks up to face you.

You watch as the giant figure shifts and turns back out of the smoke, holding across its front in one hand a large cleaver-like blade with runes glowing across the side of it. About 15 feet or so from end to end, and as it spins, it looks down towards you all and holds it in front, the flat end facing out towards you in a ceremonial way. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h33m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You know when you're close to an explosion and there's that brief minute of extremely uncomfortable heat that you flinch? It's that, perpetually and all of you are sweating masses beneath your armor. You're afraid at certain points that your eyebrows are beginning to singe and curl. It's hard to breathe because the air is so hot and so thick, and occasionally you can't help but find yourself coughing at the caustic black smoke that fills a large portion of the chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=1h34m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h35m45s">The platform is about 20 feet wide and so the chains that are all hooked at multiple places to the edges and the outside part of the anvil are taut and then dangling off the edge of the platform.

<dd id="l1h44m41s">Okay. You go and fire the arrow just past him. As you do, his head darts with the speed of the arrow as it clacks against the back of the wall. Without even looking towards you, this hand releases the blade and the blade swings a wide arc about a foot above your head, Grog.

Upon approaching the central risen platform where the anvil was, some stone-built guardian that loomed over it, upon approaching and testing the boundaries, an unintentional firing of an arrow in the vicinity seemed to have triggered an aggressive stance, and the entity seems to be on the assault. So now, with the chamber there before you, I would like you all to take stock on your current positions and roll initiative. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=2h12m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Getting a better glance around, you can see a lot of the soot and black that has gathered in the upper areas of the ceiling, which is about 50 feet high.

<dd id="l3h47m19s">Okay. You find numerous sets of tongs. You find twisting tools. You find metal punches. You find chisels of all sizes. You see a form of leg vise that's laying at the side of the anvil which you know immediately, weirdly for you, a leg vise is a small device that you use to clamp metal onto the anvil to work on it. You use your foot to hold down with pressure. You also see the hammer that was chained to it, as well, which is very well made. The dark black hammer metal look with gold inlay.

<dt><a href="#l3h48m59s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l3h48m59s">You understand, based on the discussion you guys had between the design, the platinum has to be smelted down into workable bars, ingots of metal that can be hammered and folded. You have to get into the chamber to do so because the smelting materials are in the chamber you just came from. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=3h48m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h48m59s">This is the forging chamber. The other doors are still closed. Once they're made into bars, and this is from the design that you recall Ioun gave you, the beads of divinity that you've been given, you have to actually shatter across the anvil and then fold the pieces into the metal. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=3h48m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l3h49m45s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l3h49m45s">Once that's done then you actually have a solid blank of platinum inlaid with the fragments of divinity. You then have to draw out the trammel tips, which makes them into a fine point like a long javelin-like rod. Then you have to use the vise, after heating the metal, to twist the trammels. The actual design has them twisted because it helps conduct the divine energy to the point. And then using the chiseling tools, you have to work in the runes that match and channel the incantation that Scanlan's book has. It's a multi-process step that's going to require both of you to work together on this, since some elements of it are blacksmithing elements, some of it are tinkering. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=3h49m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l4h1m34s">19's fine. The hammering isn't too hard. The different things have different difficulties, and so the folding isn't too bad. So with that, you guys take the dust and you scatter it across the metal and then hammer and fold, hammer and fold and take more and scatter it across the metal as it's still heated. Hammer and fold, then go and take it off to the side to two of the coal areas, and you watch as the furnaces burn and heat the metal up again. You bring it back up to the steps and hammer and fold, hammer and fold with more of it until eventually, you've managed to hammer in over the next 20 or so minutes, both of you sweating, feeling a little bit of stiffness and soreness in your arms from this process, but you've been far worse. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h1m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And all of a sudden, the light of the furnaces flicker back on, the machine once more (crushing). The engine slams and light filters back. You pull the hammer back.

You begin to, at an angle, hammering it against the top of the anvil, to eventually bring it to a gradual point. I need you to go ahead and make a blacksmithing check. This will be dexterity because this is less of just hammering, this is a little more careful manipulation of the metal. Did you cast Cat's Grace on him again?

<dd id="l4h15m39s">So. Now with this tinier hammer in your grasp, you walk over and put the trammels on the anvil. You grab some of the chiseling implements, and the two of you together begin to work. And you're mainly there taking the hammer and driving the back of the chisel while he's guiding the design because you don't know what vision he has. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h15m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h15m39s">So you've done all the groundwork. You've built the structure, the base plate for it. But you have all the intricate designs in the head that Ioun imparted with you. So now you almost go into a trance with the chiseling tools and you have three in your hands and you're juggling them behind and you're staring ahead. It's really weird to watch Percival go from this focused individual to staring off into space and his hands take over and begins moving the chisels along. Each one of them almost too fast for you to keep up and you get to the point where you're like (rapid hammering). <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h15m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l4h15m39s">As you do, you watch as this intricate scrolling begins to appear and dig itself into the side of each trammel. He rotates it with the tongs, moves into place, gets the chisel and removes it, rotates it again and as this continues, it gets faster and faster and faster. I need you to go ahead to make a tinkering check. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h15m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l4h23m24s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l4h23m26s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h23m26s">And with the completion of the trammels, this leg of your journey now complete, we're going to close tonight's episode. Good game. (sighs) We'll pick up this at GenCon next week at our live show. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h23m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h23m39s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h23m39s">So GenCon we're going to start with trying to get out of an active volcano? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h23m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h23m43s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h23m43s">Well, I think we'll assume that we're going to take a mansion rest and we'll come out of a mansion rest. Can we assume that's going to be it? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h23m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h23m49s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h23m49s">If you want to take that point now, we'll say with the end of this episode you guys take a mansion rest? No? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h23m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h23m57s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h23m57s">No? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h23m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h23m58s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h23m58s">Or are you tapped out? Do you have any spells left, Scanlan? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h23m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m2s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m2s">I saved one level eight spell for such a thing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m5s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m5s">So we head into the mansion. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m7s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m7s">And I technically have one 7th-level spell, so if we want to go into the mansion and then I can Plane Shift us home, we can do that. Or wherever we want. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m17s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m17s">So we can Plane Shift, mansion wherever we need. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m19s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m19s">And if we go into the mansion, the first purple servant that hands me a salad, I behead unless it's the GoFiBePo. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m28s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m28s">So are you going to long rest and then Plane Shift or Plane Shift and then long rest wherever you land? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m32s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m32s">Plane Shift and then long rest. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m34s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m34s">If we're in the mansion, he can't see us. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h24m34s">So that's the only thing. It might be good to rest inside the mansion so he can't attack us before we attack him. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m46s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m46s">Are we going straight to him? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m48s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l4h24m50s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m50s">All right. Mansion. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m51s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m51s">I will be burning my 7th-level spell at the top of the day instead of at the end. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m56s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m56s">So let's Plane Shift somewhere and mansion. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h24m59s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h24m59s">Well, no. I can only Plane Shift us on this plane by basically hacking the spell because the mansion is another plane of existence. So I can't Plane Shift us on this plane. I have to plane to another plane. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h24m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h25m16s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h25m16s">We need to rest. Let's rest. Yeah, ignore it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=2sBrNMR5FRE&t=4h25m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l4h25m20s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
