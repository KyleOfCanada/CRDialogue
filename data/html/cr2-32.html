<dd id="l0h0m32s">Well, how much of them lived? It's Barovia, to be fair. Anyway, welcome. Before we hop into tonight's game, we have some announcements to get through. First and foremost, I believe, if Sam is ready, it looks like he's stretching himself. We have our fantastic sponsor, for campaign two since day one, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h0m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m53s">D&amp;D Beyond everybody, they've been such great sponsors, putting up with my shenanigans for so long. So tonight I thought I would just do a simple, normal ad read for them. Just singing their praises of the service of the company, how they're making D&amp;D fun and easy again. So I just wrote a little, quick little-- I left it at home on my printer. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h0m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m20s">But it's okay, it's okay, no problem. I'm essentially like an improv god, right? So I'll just make something up on the fly. Just go from the heart. Okay. I like D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h1m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m17s">I will say, unfortunately, without Satan at your back, I don't think you're allowed to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons anymore. It's kind of a requirement. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h3m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m36s">We put up a video on Wednesday announcing one of our first upcoming series here on Critical Role's channel entitled Handbooker Helper. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h3m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m51s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m51s">We were discussing how excitedly the people in Hamburger Helper's marketing team are like, "Why this sudden uptick in interest in our brand?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h3m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m2s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m5s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m5s">So if you guys want to sponsor Handbooker Helper, let us know. Yeah, so anyway, it's going to be a short form series. Bite-sized video snippets, introducing people who have either never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons or want a bit of a refresher course on the 5th edition rules from the handbook, but in very easy to understand presentory fashion. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h4m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m32s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m32s">We can't tell you how many people we've been like, "You wanna know how to play D&amp;D?" And we show them the book and they go (breathy recoiling). So hopefully this will help alleviate for some folks that issue and get some more folks that you've been wanting to get on board with the game to play with you in your campaign a little more of a softer introduction to the game. Look forward to that. It launches on August 29th, right around the corner, it's going to be our first episode. So look for information on critrole.com. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h4m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m32s">Marisha, did you have anything you wanted to mention on that? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h4m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m3s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m3s">Is the Critical Role YouTube channel called "Critical Role" or "Crit Role"? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h5m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m7s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m35s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m35s">Also, for those of you guys who didn't notice, tomorrow, our production team here at Critical Role Land are going to be answering fantastic questions from the community about the whole production with this crazy, zany bunch of people. It'll be tomorrow on the Critical Role subreddit at 2:00pm Pacific Time. They'll be on there live answering questions, discussing all the chaos behind the scenes that you guys have wanted to know about. This was, if you don't recall, a special incentive that was unlocked from our fantastic 826LA charity stream that we ran a few months back. Thank you for supporting 826 and making it a fantastic charity push and we're happy to bring you this next leg of that reward journey back to you. So check it out. As a reminder, next week on Thursday will not be an in-canon episode as me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be off in a dusty place. But that doesn't mean there's not going to be a game. Actually, we are going to have a one-shot next week run by our fantastic Liam O'Brien. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h5m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m37s">So we're going to wait a little bit longer, but it's coming. I don't want to give away too much, but I'll tell you who's playing. We have La La, Sam, and Travis will be part of the game. And we are bringing in friends TJ Storm-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h6m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>

I've worked with him on many video games, a lot of us have. He's phenomenal, but he's also the kind of guy who I had no idea was a huge D&amp;D nerd until we got in an offhand conversation years ago.

<dd id="l0h12m24s">As you guys reach the southern gates to the exterior of Zadash, with the creaking of chains and the heavy (thudding) as the large wooden barriers slowly drift open to allow you and a few other carts outward onto the main road. You glance out onto the southern hills below you in the Marrow Valley and you can see the faint dusting of distant snow that has begun to melt in the recent warmer days that have come. The roads themselves are slick and heavy with mud from the snow and rainfall that has managed to still seep in. You can hear hooves making their way through the mud as you push past the barrier. Now last time you were here, you recall seeing large numbers of military that had gathered of the Righteous Brand of which there are very few left, it looks like most have gone eastward and found their way towards the skirmishes you continue to hear about on the borders of Xhorhas and the Ashguard Garrison. The gates close behind you, and you begin making your way now free again in the Marrow Valley southward towards your destination of the Menagerie Coast. First off, who is going to be guiding this first leg of the path? That is three days of travel to Alfield along the road. Who's going to be keeping an eye out? All right, we have Caleb for that.

<dd id="l0h14m0s">Because I glossed over this last session. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h14m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m0s">Caleb, as you sit there, holding the reins to the horses in front and you're focusing ahead, your mind slips back into contemplative thought recalling the time you had spent focusing on the dodecahedron, remembering when you had spent a bit of time over this two-week break studying and trying your best to understand the nature of its enchantment or history. It's a strange device to behold for sure. It both seems refined and primal. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h14m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m0s">You have no idea the source or the length of time that it's existed or what its true purpose is. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h14m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m0s">Focusing onto it, once again allowing your consciousness to slip gently towards wherever this object draws it in. It feels like you're looking into infinite space both within and beyond this small geometric shape. You take a moment to focus. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h14m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m0s">You can sense and see light and cloud and matter and vacuum, this kind of expanse of everything and nothing between these long stretches. You feel like there's an absence around you, but the more time you spend, the more you adjust to the space, the more your vision clarifies, the more the darkness is not pure darkness but a weave of millions of tiny threads, all moving, faintly traveling in different directions, tugged by some unseen force independently. You watch one thread, you pick one focus, and you can see it pulling along. And it brightens and brightens and brightens until it reaches, in that tiny little infinitesimal push, a burst of light, and it changes direction. And you see in that space where that burst of light had happened, you see seven other shadow-threads begin to emerge from that point that then fade away to nothing, the thread having now curved and taken a different path. A choice, a decision made, and a different destiny for whatever that strange thread is following. And pulling back, you now see the thousands, tens of thousands, millions of these that all wander in their own independent, solitary directions, some crossing, some parallel, some alone. And you wonder what all of this means, and what this has to do with the essence of this device, the powers that it seems to impart, and what it is that the Kryn Dynasty has designs for. You come back in to your moment on the cart as you're rocking back and forth down the pathway, hearing the hooves on the muddy-- now getting drier-- portions of the roadway. You glance around at your friends and shake your head for a moment, and focus once more on the road before you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=0h14m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There is one crownsguard who's kind of leaning against the wall. It looks like they're not asleep, but definitely not in full energy, per se.

You see them pushing barrels over, and one of them who seems to be leading this charge is like, "Well, fucking hell, where the hell did she go? It's probably just my brain playing tricks on me." And you hear them slowly walk away. They weren't fully invested in a chase. They were more just mistrusting and curious. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=1h50m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h52m40s">19, okay. We'll say, for the sake of brevity here, the first two days of travel, thanks to your tent as well and staying off the beaten path during times of rest, you manage to find some good hidden areas and no issues happen at night during the restful period. The second day goes by without issue. You do see a small grouping of merchants making their way northward with largely what is a chain of oxen. It looks like they have about 12 or so of them that are chained together and they're heading northward, having made their way through the gates, for some sort of a sale or trade. It's a curious spectacle as they come by. It's one cart and just a lot of oxen, giant horns, slowly making their way northward. As you pass around for the third day and fourth day, go ahead and make another perception check. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=1h52m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h54m1s">As you get to the very, very southern side of this valley, you begin to see as the Cyrios Mountains and the Ashkeeper Peaks begin to come and point together towards the actual Wuyun Gorge, which is this central ravine between the two mountain ranges that heads southward and exits the Marrow Valley entirely. As you approach, you begin to see the actual Wuyun Gates, which are these tall 50 foot high--- can't quite tell the width of it. You've traveled through these before once with Jester before coming into the Empire. You know the width of these walls is at least ten feet to 15 feet wide at its base. The central gates themselves are not stone, but they are two very large, iron reinforced wooden doors that stand about 20 feet tall and are opened and closed by chained based wenches that rotate and open and close from each side of the interior of the wall. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=1h54m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h54m1s">Your vision catches a troupe of about 50 or so soldiers. Not dressed in the same bits of armor as the crownsguard that you've seen as you've traversed most of this countryside, but a different set of armor. Largely bright red maroons and golds. Looks like there are some tents and there's an encampment set on this side, off to the eastern edge of the gate. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=1h54m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And with that, it drifts towards you, and, in this weird, familiar sense, you've had more than one object just enter your torso.

<dd id="l2h7m59s">No. It doesn't look like there's been any scuffle, no attacks, they haven't taken any tear from any sort of conflict, it looks like, from this end. But there are more guards up along the top, along the walkway above the wall. Previously, you guys had seen two crossbowmen that were there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=2h7m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h7m59s">There's now ten. The Righteous Brand themselves, while about 30 or so of them have been encamped in that one encampment, the rest, of about 20 or so, are scattered amongst different points on the mountains around the gate and are all scouts, keeping eyes out for anyone trying to circumvent the pinch point. There's pretty heavy interest in keeping watch on these borders, given the current conflict to the east. But you pass through safely, allowed by the crownsguard, and within a few moments, you pass into the Wuyun Gorge proper, and a wave of acknowledgement hits most of you that, for the first time, you are no longer in the Dwendalian Empire. So you pass by the six or seven carts that are in line, and there's arguments and frustration. Some of them are currently very vehemently arguing with the crownsguard who are holding them to wait their turn. You keep your heads down and continue forward. There, you start heading into this large mountain pass. Extremely steep at certain points, where the mountains seem to be have been carved down or bisected by some ancient cataclysm, whether it be the Calamity or some great natural disaster long before that. It seems to be a very unique, singular cleft down in the center of these two mountains that breaks the mountain range between the Cyrios and the Ashkeeper. Who's keeping-- you're at the front of this? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=2h7m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h10m15s">As you're stalking ahead, riding before, you can see there's bits of rock formations that have been pushed through by some sort of ancient seismic activity. There are pieces of rock that are platformed over, and there are outcroppings and caverns that have naturally been pushed out of the sides of this large ravine. It's quiet here, with the occasional echoing sound of birds squawking and cawing to each other. There's a faint wind occasionally drifting through in pulses. It's warm. The sun is above, and whereas previously you have been encountering the colder winter, especially further north of the Marrow Valley where the snowfalls have been rather consistent, the warm clothes that many of you have been wearing in that weather are beginning to capture the heat of this southern area, and as the sun is now high in the sky, cloudless, the blue above you, the beads of sweat begin to form across your back beneath your clothing.

<dd id="l2h25m25s">Ten misses. It goes wide, out of the side, and the head that was watching the bird goes (growling) and peers closer to the cart with an untrusting eye, its chin tilted to the side. This is a terrible look now. You see these very bulbous faces that are a combination of muscle and fat pushing into the eye sockets. They have these tiny, beady giant eyes. You see these round-ish, pushed-in pug noses and this large gaping jaw, ogre-like with two big tusks that protrude from underneath. Long, scraggly dark beards that pour down the sides of their face and over the front of their chest, mingling with matted bits of chest hair over this tanned and sun-weathered flesh, uncovered, made of sheer muscle and anger. You can see each head has its own series of scars and weird personality and as they're running, they're still arguing with each other as they're in the process of getting to you. "We need to go from the side!" "No! Direct attack!" On this end, the other one goes like: "Budak, don't be stupid!" The other head's like: "But Budak's our friend." "Shut up!"

<dd id="l3h5m30s">All righty. Keeping an eye out, you peruse the interior of the gorge for the remainder of its length. Eventually, the mountain gives way towards the end of your day's journey. You don't notice anything waiting in the wings on par with what you had seen before. There are some mountain wolves that wander down in a pack that notice your presence, but don't seem to bother. They tend to avoid the main road at this point. Eventually, you make your way past the dry, rocky plains just as the sun begins to set. You can see to the left of you, the Ashkeeper Peaks that continue to curl off to the horizon; the hills growing taller and more scattered across the plain in front of you to where you can't see beyond the first set. But the landscape seems to be dipping a bit beyond that, so each hill itself marks the horizon ahead of you for however long you have to travel. First night rest, as you were keeping watch, no major issue. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=3h5m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h6m39s">A thought I had earlier; point of order-- the first time I did the hut, it was bright orange, but I've learned that I can control that, so through experimentation, I would say if we are ever in a field of grass, the hut would be the color, as close as Caleb can get it, to the grass. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=3h6m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you guys come to and wake up, off the side of the main path, you glance over to the right, and you can see, from the sound of hoof prints, two carts, 30 or 40 feet off the side, heading up the road. At the front, you see a-- I wouldn't say cloaked, but hooded man with a head wrap that falls into a scarf over one shoulder, a long, gray-and-gold set of comfortable travel robes sat at the front, who's looking over in your direction. In the back of the cart, you see numerous sizes of metallic cages of some kind. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=3h7m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h28m45s">Nothing in the valley coming to your attention. All right, so as you guys gather your supplies and continue southward along the road, for the sake of brevity, we'll say for the next few days, you travel relatively uneventful, passing the odd traveler and/or messenger riding their way up or past you at a much faster speed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=3h28m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h28m45s">To your left, you can see the massive green jungle, this tangled jungle forest to the east that consumes the base of the Ashkeeper Peaks all the way just out of sight to the horizon, known as the Cuarasca Jungle. The fields and hills you follow grow darker and more dense with greenery. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=3h28m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h28m45s">The sky is more clear and a more vibrant blue than you're used to in the northern lands and the grey skies of the empire. You follow the road over a series of rising hills until you eventually crest the tallest, your eyes catching a beautiful-- and for some of you, an entirely new-- sight. Beneath the cloudless blue, the horizon comes to meet an endless stretch of deep cerulean, scattered with thousands of tiny sparkling lights, the sunlight dancing across the distant waves, giving the illusion of a million scattered diamonds glinting across what is the Lucidian Ocean. To your left, the dark green of the Cuarasca Jungle still dominates the countryside along the Ashkeeper Peaks, the now hundreds of miles of lush, tangled vine canopy stretching to the shore and stopping at the southern cliffs and beaches that give way into the endless waters. A warm breeze blows from the south as the faint scent of salt water tickles your nose. Due just south of your hilltop, southwest, the road continues to wind through the green hills and patchwork rocky mounds dotted with trees and overgrowth, eventually leading to a rather large city that sits on the coast. Dozens of boats large enough to see even at this distance cluster around the bays and docks, while the colorful rooftops and towers vary in height and design, giving an eclectic visual of a jumble of cultures having built this space without unified vision. To Fjord, this is a familiar sight. And to Jester, this is home. Welcome to the Menagerie Coast, and the port city of Nicodranas. And that's where we'll finish tonight's episode. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=aRQr1QMNHsQ&t=3h28m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
