<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hey, everybody! It's me, Sam Riegel! Welcome to Not Critical Role! I will be your host for the evening and Dungeon Master. This is the first time I've ever done this, so treat me nicely and gently. I will be guiding our players tonight through some sort of convoluted story that I've come up with. My guests for this evening are ferociously handsome and attractive people. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">Perhaps I can introduce them to you now. Over here is cabbage-smelling Brian Foster. Next to him is the fabulously talented and sultry Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. Next to her is cute-as-a-button Ashly Burch. Then my wife and yours, Liam O'Brien. Next to him, playing his first ever game of Dungeons and Dragons-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m57s">#</a> <strong>ERIC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m57s">I just got off my Uber shift, and I am terrified right now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h0m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m1s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m1s">This is Eric Bauza, man of a thousand voices. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h1m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m1s">He really doesn't know how to play at all, and didn't really practice. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h1m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m10s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m10s">He knows six percent less than you! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h1m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m15s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m15s">Yeah, that's right! I will be asking for a lot of help tonight from Liam O'Brien, as will Eric. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h1m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m20s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m20s">And I'll turn to the right and ask Matt-- he's not here. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h1m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m25s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m25s">Matt and Marisha and the rest of the Critical Role gang are on the playa in Burning Man right now, so they can't be here. Naked. Humping each other. So they can't be here tonight, but we're going to carry on without them and have a one-shot deal. We have some announcements before we go, right, Liam? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h1m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m47s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m47s">Yeah, I got some, you got some. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h1m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m49s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m49s">I'll start. First, new merch, guys! New merch available in the store right now. This awesome shirt that says Dalen's Closet in Shamal Bay. It's a little throwback to that little fun beach adventure we had with pranks and stuff. Ooh, it's so soft. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h1m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m10s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m10s">If you think that sleeves are bullshit, we have this one, as well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h2m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m14s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m14s">Wow, that's such a beachy shirt! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h2m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m16s">#</a> <strong>ERIC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m16s">You get a great tan with that shirt. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h2m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m21s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m21s">Wow, I love it! And it's available in the store already? Now? Go purchase it! Go purchase the shirts. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h2m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m29s">#</a> <strong>BRIAN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m29s">I want to see Travis wear that when he works out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h2m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m32s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m32s">There's more stuff, though. Well, the Dagger Dagger Dagger shirt is back. I know that's not brand new, but it's new-ish. The Scanlan shirt is even less new-ish, but it's an amazing shirt, and it's still there. We have the aprons still, we have pencils, we have Tarot cards. I feel like going: ooh. She's in the desert; she can't touch me right now. That's it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h2m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m54s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m54s">So that's our merch update. Liam and I will be tomorrow morning flying to Sacramento to do SacAnime. Are you doing it, Mary? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h2m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m3s">#</a> <strong>MARY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m3s">No, I have to do a red-eye on Friday night to Dragon Con. Yes, very exciting, to meet Mr. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h3m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m3s">Steve Blum there. I haven't met, I'm looking forward to it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h3m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m13s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m13s">So we'll be in Sacramento for the weekend, me and Liam, doing stuff. Come see us. Come say hi if you're in the northern central California vicinity. Sure. Any other announcements, Liam? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h3m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m32s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m32s">Yeah, we've got that art book coming out. If you want to get updates you can go over to geekandsundry.com/artbook and sign up for updates, and you'll get the latest. And then also, Taliesin's not here; he's also naked in the desert, but on Wednesday he'll be back for Wednesday Club. In addition to everything they're going to be talking about, there will be a little scuttlebutt about the Critical Role comic book. We might show you the cover of the damn thing. Other things to announce about it, so tune in if you're curious. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h3m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m2s">#</a> <strong>BRIAN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m2s">There's Talks Machina Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m6s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m6s">Oh Jesus, Brian, come on. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m8s">#</a> <strong>BRIAN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m8s">It's shameless self promotion at this point. But no, it's great, actually, to be a part of the show that I have been riding the coattails of this past year. It's great to finally be a part of the actual show. Tuesday nights, Talks Machina. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m8s">I'll talk to you guys afterward about who's going to be on, and then we'll announce. So that's it, 7:00 on these very channels. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m32s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m32s">Eric, anything to plug? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m35s">#</a> <strong>ERIC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m35s">DuckTales. That's how we do our thing. We're on DuckTales together. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m41s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m41s">Yeah, he plays many characters. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m43s">#</a> <strong>ERIC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m43s">Yes, actually, I think the 23rd may be the introduction of the many characters. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m49s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m49s">Oh is that true? September 23rd, tune in to DuckTales. He played 30 characters in one episode? Something like that. It's a lot. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m59s">#</a> <strong>ERIC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m59s">I had to sing Happy Birthday 47 times. 47 different accents. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h4m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m5s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m5s">Ash-boo, anything? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h5m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m7s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m7s">I think you're great and you're going to do a great job. Oh, OK K.O.!, which Mary's also on, is out now on Cartoon Network. Are you on it, Bauza? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h5m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m17s">#</a> <strong>ERIC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m17s">No. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h5m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m17s">(laughter) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h5m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m23s">I'm just trying to learn how to play tonight. This is my guy. It's almost like it's the same person. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h5m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m33s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m33s">All right, so with all that out of the way, let's dive into another episode of Critical Role! [dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h5m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m10s">Hi guys! Welcome back! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m13s">#</a> <strong>BRIAN</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m15s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m18s">#</a> <strong>ERIC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m18s">How many drinks do you have going there? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m20s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m20s">I have two drinks, one alcoholic-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m23s">#</a> <strong>BRIAN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m23s">And one if that one breaks down. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m24s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m24s">Okay. So needless to say, I'm super nervous because I've never done this before, but it's going to be fun, and if it sucks then who cares, right? So let's just dive in, right? I'm going to play music from my iPad. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m40s">#</a> <strong>BRIAN</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m42s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m42s">I'm now turning to my notes. All right. I'm about to begin the show. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m49s">#</a> <strong>BRIAN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m49s">This is great. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m53s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m53s">Here we go. Black and white, as far as the eye can see. The black of a cold night sky, the white of ice capping every tree and dusting the roads below. It is a frigid, monochromatic night in Jorenn Village, at the foot of the Umber Hills-- until! A flash of yellow hair, hoofbeats, a fast-moving horse, a young human woman riding at top speed through the windy night. She barrels down the street, muttering to herself, "Shit, shit, shit, I'm late again!" Then suddenly, a thunk. The horse whinnies. Did she just hit something or someone? Oh no. The young woman stops, dismounts, walks back, and sees an awful sight. An old woman in a simple grey robe, cane in a mangled hand, face bloody, arm broken. She's motionless, ashen. "Oh fuck," says the girl. "Oh my fuck. I think I-- is that a-- I just killed someone. Oh gods, what am I going to "do? I am so dead." The young woman looks around. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m53s">No one to call for a doctor. No fire-lit homes to knock on for help. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m53s">Wait. No lights. No prying eyes. No <i>witnesses</i>. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m53s">The rider takes a breath, kicks a little snow over the body of the old woman, checks the streets one more time, and then mounts the horse and gets the hell out of there, no one the wiser. She rides on, feeling guilty, but also relieved. No one saw, right? Right? In a few minutes she arrives at her destination, shivering with cold. She ties her horse to the lion statue across the street, just in time for her shift at the second crappiest tavern in town: The Ass Sailor. The sign above the door once said "The Crass Sailor," but months ago, vandals pried off the shitty letters C-R, so now it just reads, "The Ass Sailor." The name seems to have resonated with its low-life patrons and they seem to prefer it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m53s">The poorly built tavern sits on the foundation of an old chapel, and some time in the last hundred years was expanded to two stories: a pub on the bottom and rooms above. Despite its thin walls, it has one feature that regulars love on nights like this: it is notoriously warm. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m53s">The woman pushes open the door, jogs past the Ass Sailor's source of heat: a large hearth, blurred with red coals. It's a small fireplace, but no matter where you sit in The Ass Sailor, you always stay weirdly warm. So toasty, in fact, that there's a massive pile of jackets and scarves and weapons to the left of the door. Everyone inside has stripped down to the bare minimum of dress. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m53s">With the lack of clothing comes an oversupply of skin, skin of all shades and body parts. The ruddy belly of a human salesman stuffing himself on rotten mutton. The dark blue-tinted shoulder of a tiefling whore, enticing a gray, bearded, older man upstairs. The gray forearm of a half-orc merchant, drawing a mug of Greep from the keg on the bar. Greep, by the way, is a homemade house liqueur. It's so potent, its nickname is "kindling" because it is also extremely flammable. Hint, hint, hint! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h7m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m31s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h11m34s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m34s">"You're late!" calls the bar manager, Xavier, wiping his hands on his grubby chef's apron. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h11m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m34s">"I hit some unexpected traffic on the road!" replies your late-shift bartender, Valerie, as she puts on her apron and ducks behind the bar. There are a dozen tables, most populated with drunken assholes, half-witted con artists, and infectious laughter. Val gets right to work on a night that will prove to be unlike any other. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h11m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m34s">At the bar, a noble half-elf woman with fiery eyes, dark skin, and spectacular blonde hair nervously fidgets with her necklace. She glances about, looking for someone. In an elegant blue and white gown and golden jewelry, she is definitely out of place among the riffraff. This, we will learn, is Gryffin. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h11m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m34s">Val, the bartender, approaches. "Hi. So what can I get you?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=rnq3VBQu_kI&t=0h11m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
