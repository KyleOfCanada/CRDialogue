<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m7s">#</a> <strong>ALL</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m7s">We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h0m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m8s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m8s">Yeah, we do! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h0m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m9s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m9s">Yeah, okay. Before we get started, we want to give a nice thank you and talk a little bit about our fantastic sponsor for Campaign Two since the very beginning: our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Sam? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h0m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m26s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m26s">D&amp;D Beyond, everybody. If you're just joining us, you might not remember this, but I love D&amp;D Beyond so much. I love the app, I love the platform, I love the company, I love the people. I love it so much that I want to be in control of it, and run the company, which is why I'm running for president of D&amp;D Beyond. I launched my campaign a month or two ago. It's going great. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h0m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m26s">Lots of fundraising. I'm waiting for donations from you guys. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h0m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m57s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m57s">It's in process. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h0m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m59s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m59s">That's what those envelopes were that I slipped under your chairs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h0m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m2s">#</a> <strong>ALL</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m2s">Oh. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m4s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m4s">Thought that was a parking ticket. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m7s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m7s">Those are not tax-deductible. I'm pleased to announce today that I have an opponent. A big part of running for office is to have an opponent and to know who you're facing. A lot of nominations came in, a lot of suggestions. Some people couldn't do it. Marisha was actually technically too young to run. Taliesin, not a citizen of the United States. Also not sure where he is a citizen of. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m33s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m33s">It's a country that doesn't exist anymore. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m36s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m36s">Yep, that's about right. Travis didn't pass the IQ test. So what we're left with was the opponent that will be running against me for the presidency of D&amp;D Beyond is: (drumroll) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m51s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m51s">Oh, is that a drumroll? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m53s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m53s">Liam O'Brien! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m55s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m55s">Oh, man. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m57s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m57s">We're friends, so I hope we run a respectful campaign. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h1m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m1s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m1s">The word is frenemies. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m3s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m3s">Yeah. I'm going to do my best to not-- the problem here is that I'm sort of a master of media. I'm politically savvy. The people love me. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m3s">I've been doing this for a while. I got Dani Carr as my campaign manager. I've got it going on. So I don't know what you've got in store for this campaign, but it's not going to be all that. But whatever. I'll give you the floor. Let's see what you got. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m28s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m28s">Well, all I can say is thank fuck for a two-party system. Sam Riegel, you're adorable. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m28s">You're quick-witted. You're clever. You're good in bed, but this is the adults' table. Roll the motherfucking clip! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m43s">#</a> <strong>NARRATOR</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m43s">(VO) And now a message from Liam O'Brien. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m47s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m47s">My fellow tabletoppers, I am coming to you in these dark times to bring sense and reason to the table. For too long has our great game been sliding into a lugubrious den of iniquity, malfeasance, and ineptitude. We live in a world where any Tom, Dick, and Harry can come waltzing into the hallowed halls of both dungeons and dragons with half-baked backstories and Cockney accents in hand, and run roughshod over the time-honored traditions of fantasy make-believe. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m47s">My opponent in the race to be president of D&amp;D Beyond has relied too long on charm, quick thinking, creative character choices, and that cartoonishly large parasail he calls a smile. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m47s">Sure, he and his compatriots have peddled you a steady stream of things like heart, humor, complex exploration of the human condition, and the playing of roles in this role-playing game. But at what cost? At. What. Cost. As your next president of D&amp;D Beyond, I am running on a platform of accountability, on the rule of law, and the law of the rules. I promise a new era of gravity and honor. No longer will Hunter's Mark be mismanaged. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m47s">Rages will be raged when it is indeed time to rage, whether you'd like to or no. And so help me Larkin, every rogue will know precisely when and how to implement the assassinate feature. Enough is enough. My opponent would have you believe that D&amp;D is about story, adventure, magic and wonder. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m47s">Don't you believe it, my friends. Don't you believe it. With me as your next president, we will rediscover the true joy of gaming: systemic memorization. To d4, or not to d4: that is the question. Thank you, and gods bless D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m47s">(VO) I'm Sam Riegel's husband and I approve this message. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h2m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m17s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h5m22s">I leave it up to the people to decide. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h5m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m24s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m24s">I don't like this. I don't like this at all. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h5m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m24s">I don't have a video, I don't have a logo. I don't have American flags behind me, or wheat fields, or whatever that shit was. Dani, what are you doing to me?! We need a video! Ooh, you're going down. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h5m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m24s">Do you remember what I said about a respectful campaign? Fuck that, the gloves are off, motherfucker, you're going down. I will rule D&amp;D Beyond! Back to you, Matt. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h5m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m51s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m51s">Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Liam. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h5m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m56s">Next announcement. Those who haven't seen The Search for Grog, our special Vox Machina one-shot from our live show in LA, will air tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h5m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m56s">So tune in to the Critical Role Twitch channel at 7:00 pm Pacific to watch it. If you miss the live broadcast, you can check out the VOD on Saturday at youtube.com/criticalrole. Travis, you've got something-- Not Travis, Laura, actually. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h5m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m26s">So just a reminder, the preorders for our amazing Mighty Nein and Vox Machina art prints, those end tonight at 11:59. That's signed and unsigned, go to the store if you want them because once they're gone, they're gone. Also, speaking of once they're gone, they're gone: I've got one more thing that I want to tell you about. Which is-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h6m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m54s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m54s">So at our live show for The Search for Grog, we had posters for sale for The Search for Grog. And we thought we sold out of them but then we found an extra box, so we're putting them in the store. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h6m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m8s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m8s">These are in the store right now. There's not a whole lot of them, so if you grab one, go to the store right now and you can find them. Once they're gone, they're gone for real, because there's no more. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h7m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m54s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m54s">Yes, right. So we dropped a little tease of things to come on our Twitter and Facebook pages this morning. We were all quite blown away by how fucking fast you solved our little puzzle. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h7m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m54s">Especially @TimothyGElsy on Twitter, who was the first to crack the code. He made M.I.T. proud. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h7m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m54s">It's cool, DARPA's very proud of you. We have a puzzle if you haven't seen it, it should be up. We are excited to announce tonight that on March 4th, we are launching a Kickstarter project to create our very own Vox Machina animated special. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h7m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h8m42s">Just let it sink in. Let it sink into your body. Let it get in through your skin and your meat and your bones. There will be more details to share leading up to launch day, but since you cracked it so fast we just had to let y'all know what's going down. So get hype. (singing) Get hype.

<dd id="l0h9m15s">I know what I'm getting you for every day, ever. Thank you, Travis. As you guys may have noticed, we do have a new Twitch overlay that we unveiled tonight. We wanted to spruce things up a bit and we hope that you love it as much as we do, for all the work we did on it. Little changes, little aesthetic changes. We're also working on a few special things to enhance your live-viewing experience that we'll share more about that just as soon as we can. Some cool optional bells and whistles and we'll roll it out as we get the opportunity. An important update, starting this week with episode 52-- which you're seeing tonight-- Critical Role will air on the Critical Role Twitch channel with the VOD available for Critical Role Twitch channel subscribers over the weekend. VOD will also be available on the critical role YouTube channels on Mondays at 12:00pm Pacific. Talks Machina will also air on the official Critical Role channels moving forward. Geek &amp; Sundry's Twitch channel will still host Critical Role and Talks Machina episodes on Tuesday and Thursday nights so you can continue to watch there if that's where you're subscribed. We just wanted to take a moment to thank all the folks at Geek &amp; Sundry and Legendary Digital Networks for a long and successful partnership and we wish them the absolute best.

<dd id="l0h12m37s">Welcome back! Welcome back. So, last we left off, The Mighty Nein, in search of Nott's kidnapped husband had made their way east beneath the Marrow Valley, skirting the Underdark, under the Ashkeeper Peaks and have emerged into the ashen wastes of Xhorhas. You came in contact with one of the roving scout regiments of the empire who were immediately assaulted by a roving crew of assassins and hunters made of gnolls and a Kryn warrior and some sort of a mage using a new form of magic you've never seen before. You engaged in the battle, and after some blows were tossed back and forth the enemies-- at least the ones with enough strength to survive the encounter-- fled when it seemed like it was not turning in their favor. Left behind, you got some materials from the survivors of the imperial scouting troop and made your way through the wastes eastward. Along that way, you began to encounter some of the distant strange beasts that wander these lands. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h12m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m37s">You endured the heavy rains and were suddenly hunted by a large, somewhat unwell, roc-- a massive bird that you thought was sweeping towards you, but instead seemed to be hunting a troop of bugbear hunters <i>and</i> you. Through some clever use of illusionary magic and some decent stealth rolls, you managed to avoid getting involved in that fray and instead came upon the mostly torn apart troop of bugbears with one survivor who had been playing possum. Noticing that he was still breathing, you decided to have a conversation where you came to an understanding which involved: we're not going to kill you, give us some information, and maybe let me tattoo your body. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h12m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h15m6s">Yeah. As the last evening began to come to a close, you could see the distant fire light of what you've now been informed to be Asarius, the City of Beasts, and the home to this bugbear Gluzzo you had encountered. Camping up for the night, this far out of the vicinity, you found yourselves sleeping protected underneath Caleb's dome, your hut, and prepared yourself for a morning journey wherever you see fit. That's where we left off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h15m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You do see, now in the daylight, some sort of a perimeter wall. Looks to be a gray or purple hue; it's hard to really tell from this distance. You can see watchtowers scattered along the outskirts a little bit. You can vaguely see one one spire, loosely central to the entire shape of the city's skyline.

<dd id="l0h41m17s">Watchtowers peaking over at a number of points along. Knowing Caleb's direction sense thanks to his feat, you're approaching from a southern-southwestern direction. Batches of mud fields surrounding the eastern end of the city are visible where crews of hobgoblins and bugbears harvest roots and tubers and other strange and hardy produce from the unexpectedly cultivable land around this city. The western side, which would be to your left, outside the walls is dense with wheeled carts, armored orcs, gnolls, and other goblinoid soldiers checking and cleaning equipment and occasionally bickering. You can see, though the war is on that side of Xhorhas, there is still a military presence here. Your eyes catch the rare Kryn soldier who's wandering through the ranks keeping the peace and checking in with members of this regiment. A handful of large hills sit among the crews, resting places for ballista and supplies as goblins lift and unload boxes and affix heavy artillery to the top of these mounds. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h41m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You're in awe of this and noticing the numerous mounds now: four, five visibly scattered amongst this war band. A series of growls and muffled barks catch your attention towards the front ranks where you can see numerous large, tailless, panther-like beasts tethered to heavy posts, saddled and lightly armored for future combat. You glance past the small army beyond that, beyond the mounds to see two gargantuan shapes making a wide perimeter around the city loosely in your direction. A pair of the massive furred hulks that you first saw when you first entered Xhorhas in the distance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h43m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h43m21s">They're stalking around the wastes and the surrounding grounds. Heavy iron chains wrapped like a harness across their 20-foot wide torso each mounted by an armored Kryn who's rocking back and forth with each impact of its huge tree trunk-like limbs dragging itself through the muck and mud. You can see squat legs dragging it forward as its limbs pull it forward like a heavy gorilla. All covered in a dark gray-brown fur that's matted with mud and grime. The face of the creature, which you see for the first time now that it's getting close enough, rests between the shoulders without neck or really a head. Just embedded between where the shoulders are as part of the torso. A gray, scaled, leathery brow that folds around four red eyes the size of cannonballs arranged much like a spider's face and a tangle of teeth and tusks that protrude from a frighteningly wide mouth that almost leads from shoulder to shoulder at the very front. (stomping) As it shifts forward, one of the mouths opens and you see this large, heavy, thick tongue pull off and scrape against the tusks and then withdraw into the mouth and the jaw closes shut. You can feel on the ground with each heavy limb fall (stomping). <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h43m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You can see orcs that are dragging hunted quarry behind them through the mud or over their shoulders some of them still struggling, not quite dead from the wounds they sustained before an orc just takes it and slams it across its back so it goes to stillness and stops moving. Not a lot of conversation, but occasional bickering and growling at each other. There is still a civilized sense of order to this. More than you would have assumed based on the interactions you've had with gnolls and other such creatures who seem to live in these spaces. Goblins especially. And you do see goblins. You do see goblins and goblin-kin children rushing through the alleys and scurrying off into the roads. Clusters of them carrying something together. Some of them just trying to wait for something to drop or be left or forgotten from one of the larger folk and then just scavenged and taken away. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h49m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h59m50s">As you guys pass the small goblin neighborhood to your right, you hear the familiar barks that had echoed from the army earlier. You pass a preserve/livery for those panther-like beasts. You can see a numerous number of these kept in this large pen. They have these chain collars around their neck, and they're all tethered to a central, heavy pole that's currently pressed deep into the mud. There are some of them that are lying and sleeping; some of them are hungrily pacing on the outside of the pen, looking at the passersby and growling. Getting a better look at it, you can see they have this wonderfully aerodynamic profile to them. Their head and neck are sloped all the way past their shoulders to the back. Basically, it isn't until the hind haunches that the curvature ends. What it is is this super slick, matted, thick, heavy, wiry fur that itself is a dull gray-purple color. It seems matted at the top, and then it tends to fluff out a bit once you get past where the shoulders and the pits are of its appendages. It's very panther-like in its physicality, just more muscular and lean and stretched. A little more exaggerated in its feline figure, aside from the fact that its head is this continuous, muscled neck into a sloped, toothy mouth at the front. You can see on the sides these two large, bulging, almost creepily fish-like eyes that are lidless and poke out the sides of the head, looking out in both directions. In the front, there is not a classic cat nose, but it looks almost like a cat skull, but flesh pulled over it. It has these two open slits that are long in the front. Its jaw hangs open with these two large tusks that curl up in the front, and its tongue dangles out the front. (panting) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=0h59m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h2m7s">You can see portions of it are the stone structure, and then elements of dark, almost tinted glass seem to make it up like a cathedral spire.

<dd id="l1h2m7s">Most of the buildings are built close to the ground, whether it be from limitations on the people who constructed it or a cultural indifference to trying to make things with multiple layers. You can see the distinctly elven elements to its design and structure, which makes it stand out even more against the rest of the city.

<dd id="l1h2m7s">Not terrible, but they love their mud, and this is a good space for them. You can see one pen that has these giant aurochs that are being kept as beasts of burden that are penned into each other into a small space. There's a portion of the ground where more of those roots-- similar to those large fields you saw being cultivated on the outside of the city-- there's a smaller version of it being placed here. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=1h2m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

He leads you inside and this is a holding area. The breeding grounds are underneath. They're brought up here and out into the pen as they get older, possibly. Inside here, there are large bundles of food. There are big piles of rolled chain that have been coiled, and there is a hatch that leads into a downward slope. He goes over to it, opens the hatch, and goes, "All right, come on. Follow me," and heads down into the darkness. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=1h28m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The chamber curves a little bit, then goes straight, and then it splits off into two. There are two doors: heavy iron doors. One of them has a small barricade that's slipped in on the right side. The one on the left side has multiple pieces of metal pushed and propped up against it, chains wrapped around it, and a series of other poles and tools and things that are pushed up to try and keep it closed and at bay, as well as other furniture thrust against it.

<dd id="l1h37m0s">Okay. Frumpkin heads into the chamber. It is a rough, carved tunnel that descends into a subterranean cavern; maybe 50, 60 feet across before it comes to an end. It's not very wide, and it has a small opening towards the beginning, pinches a bit, and then curves around the side to end. It is damp, it smells awful, and as Frumpkin, stepping down into the first area, you can see bones scattered across the front area. Small bones, at least small for the creatures that were in here. They look human-sized in their tinier age, I guess. You see across one cluster, one mostly picked-clean body of what may have been a young moorbounder. Probably 30 or 40 large, crusty rats are clustered up over the body. Some of them are fighting for each other, squeaking at each other. Some are looking in the direction of the sound and the little bit of light that's peeking through from the door, that's now been pushed to the side, and the Light spell that Caduceus has been maintaining, and they're all pulling strips of flesh and whatever remnants they can from the bones and the corpse of one of these creatures. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=1h37m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h38m31s">Okay. Frumpkin looks up at the ceiling, and there are a few rough bits of rock and stone that seem to have, either through ancient seismic activity, pushed through this cavern. While it was partially carved, there were some pieces of heavy stone that couldn't be carved, and as such they protrude and arc down a bit. Looking up, pressed between where these two stones are jutting out, there is some sort of a creature. No details to be seen, but a large creature that has currently pressed all of its limbs against the two sides of the rocks, and it's suspended looking down. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=1h38m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

They all gleam in your direction, and then a few more. There's a large cluster of rats over there.

<dd id="l2h15m51s">All righty. At the end of that turn, you hear (snarling). Leaping from that ceiling portion down towards where Yasha is, you see a massive beast entity. In some ways catlike and some ways doglike, it has large, bone-like spined protrusions along the row of its back, between its shoulder blades. You can see patches of fur and robust ribs that are pushing against very tightly-pulled skin. It looks like it's starved or itself gaunt and skeletal in nature, but it is probably about ten feet from front to back. As it leaps down towards her, it attempts to make a multiattack on Yasha. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=2h15m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h5m40s">14 points of piercing damage, all right. As they're assaulting it and striking into it, you notice the nature of the swarms, it's hard to hit, and they're clustering. So it takes the damage, but it's not taking as much as you would think based on the nature of it being a swarm. So all the beetles are swarming in and attacking it, the rats are defending themselves.

The rotting-flesh smell that you smelled when you first came into the chamber, when you get close to these creatures-- now that the adrenaline has worn off and you can actually take a moment to process all the senses-- this very molded-citrus-type, acrid smell emanates from their bodies along with long-rotted flesh. It is an awful smell from these creatures. In ways, parts of them remind you of hyena-dogs with these large ridges along the back of the spine, the tail extremely venomous. You guys move past and head around the other corner. You pass by other bones and other corpses of what were smaller moorbounders, pups that were being trained or risen and fed, and in the back corner, Nott, you see it first and Caleb just seconds after, there is this faint glow, this very faint red glow. It looks like a crack in the stone. You approach and look at it, and as soon as you look at a side angle, the crack isn't on the stone; it's about an inch away from it. It's in the air, and it's about two feet across, like that, and about an inch sliver. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=3h16m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You can see heavy barrels containing three, four-foot-long metallic bolts with hooked and jagged edges that are used for piercing and destroying boundaries and borders, walls, doorways.

<dd id="l3h36m5s">Passing by those carts as they're wheeled southward towards the gate, you make your way to the outside of the Aurora... Hold. That's the word I was looking for. As you approach now, it stands out like a sore thumb against the majority of the architecture in the interior of Asarius. It almost resembles, in its design, a classic church and steeple, where it has this gradual incline on the edges that come to a partial roof, and then the central spire shoots up into this gradual point about three stories off the ground. Along it, it's not smooth. The edges are ridged, and you can see intricate details where it has this hooked-- in some ways similar to a pagoda, how it edges outward in these curves and points, where the roofs come to a gentle end and slope. There are a number of beautiful, beautiful glass windows that are stained glass, but as opposed to multicolor, it looks like a more muted palette of grays and purples and silvers and blacks and blues. From the outside, it doesn't look as gorgeous, but as you walk up to the front door, which is already open on the inside, what light comes through fills the interior with this very calming, blue-purple color that has this strangely welcoming and almost chilled atmosphere to it. As you approach, you see two Kryn soldiers walk by. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=3h36m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Stepping into the initial chamber, the light that fills the inside, it's beautiful. It's warmer on the inside, and there's no desk, more than a set of chairs-- comfortable, well-made chairs, once again standing out against most of the furniture and the living spaces you've already encountered, even in cursory glances across the city. As you enter the chamber and look around, there are two doors, one to the right and one to the left.

He is wearing dark gray-silver robes and bright, shiny, little pins that mark where the clavicle and the shoulder meet. As he peeks through and goes, "Can I help you?", the other door opens, and you see a drow girl, young, maybe late teens, early twenties. Bright silver-white hair that is pulled into a high ponytail and then two tendrils that go past the front of the ears and dangle down to about mid-chest. Beautiful, solid gray-blue skin, almost amber-colored eyes, as she peeks through wearing a similar robe as to him, and goes, "Hello?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=3h39m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

This chamber seems to be divided into two sides. Heading down this way, you pass a closed door on the right, a second closed door on the right, a third closed door on the right, and each door has a guard there. The guards are wearing mantles that are similar to, or of the same design as, the Kryn armor and the mantle you saw on the mage that you fought, when you first came to Xhorhas. It's just the mantle, and it's adorning the simple silver-gray robes that the other figures in this building seem to be wearing. The interior is beautiful. Whereas a somewhat plain exterior, aside from the general shape and curvature of the edges of the building, the interior walls here have beautiful scrollwork chiseled into all the stone. Each doorway frame has this ivy-type texture that curls and swirls around the door frame. A lot of effort and work has gone into the construction of this building. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=3h42m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

They both look at you both and step aside. Beyond that, you see a beautiful, tall, high-back lounge chair that extends out with this deep reddish-purple hue, like a velvet. The rim on the outside that curls around it, also beautifully done in a brass color that spirals on the edges. You can see a small altar in the center of the chamber, about three feet from the foot of this, and this altar heads up in this slow, gradual, spiralling point, almost like there were two paths of a tapering tower. At the top, you see a brass dodecahedron. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=3h44m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Her hair is long. It goes past her hips, and tumbles off the edges of the chair.

<dt><a href="#l4h5m53s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h5m53s">You exit the city. You find yourself a comfortable place on the outskirts, which is not too hard. There are actually a number of tents on the outside of the city where some folks just don't have spaces inside Asarius to find home, or some folks that prefer to sleep out under the stars. There are a number of campsites ahead out there, especially over by where the large portion of the army is set. You can see a number of fires and light systems. The sun eventually crests for the day where all the soldiers are scattered and still preparing for whatever movement is ahead of them. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=4h5m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l4h6m28s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l4h6m28s">Okay. As you guys are preparing and dusk sets in, you do see one of those large beasts looming towards the city, just naturally wandering in that direction, and begins to gain some speed (booming footsteps) towards the edge. You hear a horn go (ascending call) and another one (lower-pitched answer) off behind it, and you see a few soldiers come rushing out on that end of the gate as this huge beast is looming towards it. It gets close, and then suddenly skids to a stop and turns around and bolts the opposite direction. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=4h6m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h6m28s">They repel it, though you are not certain of the means or use. It runs the opposite way for about a quarter mile, and just stops and sits there. You watch and it slowly begins to mosey northward, away from the city. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=REyVoebe06E&t=4h6m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
