<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Before we get into it, first off I wanted to welcome back our fantastic Ashly Burch. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

We will at some point this evening have another guest joining us, which we'll introduce as she comes in. We have already announced her, so it doesn't matter, why am I holding it back? Sumalee Montano will be joining us, but she'll be coming in as the narrative requires. In the meantime, let's get through some announcements. First and foremost, we have our fantastic sponsor for the campaign, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h0m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m55s">D&amp;D Beyond, everybody! As mentioned last week, the newly revamped digital character sheet for D&amp;D Beyond has released. With improved desktop and tablet views, better at-a-glance information, all kinds of customization, and an updated PDF export. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h0m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m14s">As you guys all remember--not you; a couple months back, I asked you Critters out there who use D&amp;D Beyond to write in and tell me about their D&amp;D Beyond experiences. With the studio move and stuff, things got lost. Some of the letters got lost a little bit, or misplaced, but we found them. I'm going to read you some of the letters from the fans. They're from a couple weeks ago. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h1m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

I'm still really sad about it, but watching "your show is taking my mind off the loss. I love how Critical Role doesn't remind me about that "death all the time."

I'm enclosing a photo of a tattoo I just got; it's my first and I'm very proud, as you "can see. That's Nott and Mollymauk dancing together. I know it's in cursive, so you might not "be able to read that they're both saying, 'We're going to live forever!' What do you think?"

<dd id="l0h2m58s">Last but not least, we got an actual letter from the D&amp;D Beyond corporation, which also got lost and found. It says, "Dear Sam: Hey, let's refrain from anything sad or emotional in your ads "this week. We want players to associate our app with fun, not intense loss that might trigger "feelings of pain or misery. Keep it light! Do one of those dumb songs you write. Oh, and give our "love to Taliesin! He's our favorite, and he's the only reason we advertise on your show." I could not have planned it because those are from weeks ago, Matt. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h2m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m13s">We're going to be also at New York Comic Con in October, which we're excited about. Our Comic Con panel is this Saturday, July 21st at 6:30pm in room 6BCF. We'll air the panel next Tuesday in place of Talks Machina, so if you aren't there at the event, you'll still have a chance to see the panel next week, so look for that. The details are at CritRole.com. I will also be doing a cartoon voices panel that same day on Saturday at 1:00pm in the same room, 6BCF. Ashly, I believe you have something going on at Comic Con as well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h4m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m42s">I'm going to be moderating the final San Diego Comic Con Adventure Time panel, because the series is ending. It will be fun, but probably sad, but fun! It'll be fun. I was told to keep it light. So I'm keeping it light. Then in the evening, I'm going to be joining the good, good boys of The Adventure Zone at their live show. So I'm getting my D&amp;D fill. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h4m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m12s">Awesome. Moving on from that. We have Talks Machina every Tuesday. Next week, you'll be able to see the panel. The week after that, you'll be able to talk about whatever next week's episode is and this week's episode together! Every Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here on Geek &amp; Sundry's Twitch or Alpha, where our fantastic host, Brian W. Foster, destroys our sense of well-being and worth of living. If you want to submit or email your GIFs and fanart, give them to submit@talksmachina.com. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h5m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m12s">Currently only the US and Canada, excluding Quebec, are available for those giveaways because of weird laws. Check it out. A reminder that we have our Wyrmwood giveaways during the break of Critical Role, but they are back under the Critical Role Twitch stream. When we come to the break towards the middle of the evening, we'll announce it, you move over to the Critical Role Twitch, twitch.tv/criticalrole, to be able to enter it then. Keep your eyes posted, and I will notify you as that comes about. That is all I've got as far as announcements, anyone have anything else they want to talk about? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h5m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h9m0s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h9m0s">Okay then. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein were making their way northward across the northern side of the Marrow Valley, toward the city of Shadycreek Run, to fulfill the second of two jobs they had accepted from The Gentleman while they were in Zadash. Along the journey, while they were leaving Hupperdook in the middle of the night, three of their members had been taken. It was discovered in the morning when they were nowhere to be found, that they had been captured by a group of slavers traveling north back to the city of Shadycreek Run itself. Upon investigating the details of this capture, you encountered an individual coming up the road with a similar aligning interest, Keg. In discussing the means of traveling to find these individuals responsible, and discovering that Keg had information on them, you decided to travel together making your way around the Crispvale Thicket. Encountering a number of indigenous, insect-like creatures known as ankhegs near the long-abandoned farmlands that were once built in the outskirts of the forest. Camping inside, you encountered a few members of a firbolg village that had long existed, hidden from the world within this thicket that had been assaulted by these same slavers, known as the Iron Shepherds. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h9m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m0s">You encountered an elder protector of this tribe, along with a boy who had survived this encounter, and were sent off on your way. Traveling northward on horseback, you managed to catch up and actually make ground on the Iron Shepherds. Comparing your intel, and through a few surprises as to what they were carrying, a plan was hatched to set an ambush, to halt them in their tracks, and assault them. Upon the plan taking off, things were going in your favor, but through a series of bad lucks-- A bad lucks, the plural, it's an actual English phrase. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h9m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m9s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m9s">That's how bad they were. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h11m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m10s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m10s">They were bad. A series of moments of bad luck, and a too-late realization of the overwhelming power of the foe you faced, one of you fell. Mollymauk lies slain in the middle of the road at the hands of Lorenzo, the leader of the Iron Shepherds. Making an example, pushing Keg onto the ground, leaving her with the knowledge of what he perceives as her fault, to live with it; and to spread their name and the terror of what they do, and not to let anybody else get in their way. You all watched quietly, unable to really have a moment yet, to digest what has happened, as you see the carts slowly, quietly, make their way northward: out of sight beyond the hills, towards your eventual destination. And that's where we begin. There's a faint bit of snowfall that's still coming down from the clouds above you there in the valley. The flurry, the storm that has been encroaching is not that far off. You look down past the somewhat-muddy tracks of the wheels of the carts that had headed away from you, your horses still stashed alongside the outer hills in which you had set this ambush. You look down to the bloodied, still body of Mollymauk, as the snow slowly begins to fall and rest upon his form. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=0h11m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h4m22s">As you guys continue your trek northward for the next day, you slowly push forward and watch as the rolling hills of this northern valley begin to even out. The high grasses growing dense and dusted with snow in the wake of this snowstorm that has passed through the night. It's now this beautiful, ice topped wonderland before you. As the storm is past, breaks in the clouds begin to slowly emerge and show you glimmers of blue in the sky. With sunlight comes a welcome comparative warmth, and this dusted field of diamonds begins to slowly thaw over the midday's journey. The looming peaks of the Dunrock mountain range approach closer, engulfing your horizon almost like a toothy jaw of some ancient titan that surrounds your peripheral. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=1h4m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h4m22s">It's like a spiral fracture of a bone, where suddenly what was once a solid mountain range seems to have torn and sundered into two separate ravines that seem to share a similar shape. This you recognize as the Quannah Breach. You guys begin to approach, by mid to late afternoon, the front of the breach, where you can see six crownsguard in a small outpost built at the base of the Quannah Breach. These, as you know, are usually folks that essentially warn people from traveling into the Breach, and if they do, let them know that any return is going to be probably highly searched and highly inquired. They enforce it, unless you slip them some coin. Then it's not an issue on the way back. They're more there to make money. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=1h4m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The air grows colder still, as white banks of snow and ice frame various ledges and outcroppings along these strangely curved and smoothly sheared cliffsides. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=1h10m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Your eyes, at first, notice a few dozen wooden poles carved into spikes that emerge from the ground, pointed in your direction from the base, many of which are stained dark while others still bear the weathered skulls of warning.

You hear the gates (clunking) behind you. Now, looking ahead, you can see the curvature of the ravine opens up into a widening valley. You see a limitless forest of climbing pines, spruce-like trees, only the common green you expect stands instead an unexpected purple-gray in color. This wide blanket before you of this deep valley of fading purple and gray color at the tops of theses trees. Along the tree line, you can see a sprawling and matted line of snow-capped buildings, hovels, and mud-covered streets that vanish into this dense forest. The city does not keep the normal cohesive shape of most, instead being a long line built along the tree edge and some sort of river or creek that it has been constructed against.

A wagon appears stuck in the mud as you pass it, rough-looking folk tugging at it and stopping to stare you down as you slowly move past. They continue their work. You nearly step over someone with your horse who appears to be passed out, face down in a patch of dirty snow. A bit of crimson rests at their side. They're not moving. As you circle around them you watch as two rough-looking fellows in hide clad armor come and inspect him. As you glance over your shoulder, you watch as they rummage through his pockets, lift up his not moving body and dump him in one of the nearby alleys and keep on walking. You see no Crownsguard. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=1h23m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The road doesn't go far north from where you enter as most of the town is this long stretched bar, so within 15 minutes you've hit the plaza. The central plaza to the town that you know as the Clover Plaza. You see log benches dotting the open area, while a four story tower of motley colored stones stands vigil over the area. Two balconies and a top, housing crossbow and longbow wielding roughnecks. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=1h24m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h24m36s">You know these to be Taskers. You're heading towards The Landlocked Lady? Easy to see. On the eastern side of this plaza, there is a very beautiful, two story complex, that comparably seems ostentatious against the buildings immediately to the right and left of it which look to be in serious disrepair and rather rundown and colorless. Just bland woods, gray and brown. Here you can see the second story above the main archway, a curved top arch, there is a false bow of a ship that is emerging outward. This beautifully carved mermaid in the front that is clutching the piercing front of the ship. There it rests with a sign dangling from it, saying The Landlocked Lady. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=1h24m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It's such a stark shift from the dreary and generally muck-covered exterior of this city, to step into what seems oppressively luxurious.

<dd id="l1h37m4s">Everything seems to have been here for a while or seems to have been weathered through travel or use. The immediate shine begins to fade as you begin to see how much of this is probably a fair amount of work to keep the upkeep of the facade of luxury. To the left of you, you can see a carved window-like bar or a desk and there behind it you can see a human man, probably in his late 30s. His hair, very short, and the male pattern baldness is just starting to set in. You can see a bit of the shine of the back of his head begin to poke through. He has a very well kept handlebar mustache that curves out very wide to each side of his face, and a pointed Van Dyke matching beard point that comes to the bottom. He has a vest over a light green billowing shirt that has a wide collar that curves out to the sides. As you enter and take in, he immediately glances over to meet your gaze and goes, "Why hello everyone, glad you "could make it. Welcome! Welcome to the Landlocked Lady. How could I be of service?

Together, we're sort of living life now, aren't we? Before, we were in the darkness. So I know we have things to do, and I want to do them. But the reason I want to find these people and rescue them is not to use them, and it's not because we've invested time in them, but it's because I love them. We need to find them and rescue them because we're a team now. So if you're just using them or whatever, that's fine and I'll support you; but I want to find them so that we don't go back to the way it was, when we were hiding in the shadows and ducking into alleys to get away from people. We were safe, but we weren't really alive, right? With these people, we're having fun and winning contests and killing bad guys and rescuing children, and it's amazing.

It's strange and not straight in places, and it was designed to follow the southern border of this forest.

<dd id="l2h16m44s">Not bad. That works. You've been at this for a while. The Savalierwood has been cursed for many centuries. The once-green forest now stands a greyish purple ashen color that it now holds and the superstition and mythology around it has allowed the city of Shadycreek Run to prevent Empire encroachment. They built the city into the space, and every time the Empire has attempted to move forward they've pulled back and used it as a defensive position. Essentially, over a number of conflicts, the Empire just gave up, and let the region exist on its own. It is dangerous, the wood. The deeper in, the more dangerous it gets. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h16m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h17m42s">Continuing on you begin to enter the canopy of the south Savalierwood. The shade completely consumes the city at this point, even though it's mid-morning and the clouds are broken up so that occasional bits of warmth and sunlight would occasionally pass through the city, now it seems like it's almost dusk immediately. Occasionally you see a leaf tumble past, and then another. It's almost beautiful, the color, but it does have almost a decaying sense to its meeting between grey and purple. It's beautiful in light, and then when it hits the ground it almost looks like it's bereft of life. You don't understand the nature of this enchantment, whatever this curse may be that you've heard of. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h17m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h26m1s">You guys all start keeping up and jogging behind it. You watch as it goes (flapping) and it lands on a post, lands on a little roof, looks back at you, (whistling) (flapping) and it's waiting and showing you a path through these streets. In doing so, you're dodging past-- originally when you walked in there were broken down tent cities and hovels and not a good space. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h26m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h26m1s">Here the road and alleys break down. It's more sparse. The buildings are further apart. It's less of like a gridded city and more of a cluster of buildings that are generally more well made, and you get the sense that this is the wealthier area. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h26m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h26m1s">You in your experience know that the North Clover is where most of the tribes, the different ruling families, exist and claim their territory. You move past a couple of buildings, eventually the bird bringing you to a beautiful, two-story estate that's in the beginning stages of showing disrepair. The dark-red wood appears imported, and the tall stone fence that encircles the building is topped with six-inch spear tips. A few that look bent and off kilter, but still dangerous enough for somebody who wished to try and leap the six, seven-foot fence. The courtyard houses a once beautiful garden that now turns grey with the winter. You can see rose bushes that have since browned and withered but the roses still slowly left there to dry and lose color. You can see in the center of this courtyard a small fountain of some kind, but now it's filled with slushed snow, and here the bits of the snow that have been pushed off the streets, give way to this estate that's glaring now at the outskirts of the forest. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h26m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h26m1s">You can see beyond it, it's just wood. This definitely marks, at least at this part of Shadycreek Run, the end of the city, before you begin to crest into the Savalierwood itself. There are three individuals that are wearing simple chain mail, that are walking inside the courtyard. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h26m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h26m1s">One has a crossbow at their side, the other has a shortbow across their shoulder. One is sitting, looking out. The other looks like they're eating some sort of dried meat from a pouch, and they glance over and watch as you approach and keep an eye. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h26m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h32m47s">"Open the gate." The guard who was eating earlier, puts the shortbow over the shoulder, still looking wary, and they're not moving from where they're standing. They're all keeping a very close eye on all five of you. Opens the gate (clicking) (creaking). The metallic gate swings open, and you're all brought into the courtyard. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h32m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h32m47s">As you're begin to follow the first guard you spoke with, they all slowly coalesce behind you, still keeping their weapons at the side, but ready if need be. As you're led to the interior chamber of this estate, the Estate Sybaritic. As soon as you enter the main foyer, the earthy smell of the forest gives way to the lingering scent of a recent meal. As if the cooked meats and starches that were eaten maybe an hour or two beforehand still permeate the air of this entryway. You see before you a staircase that continues upward, red carpeted, before switching back to a second floor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h32m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h32m47s">In that center landing you can see a very open window that looks down to possibly a backyard of some kind, but currently the view is of the darkened leaves and bits of sunlight that break through. It seems like something that was built for a beautiful view, not understanding until it was completed that it didn't really catch much of a view amongst this forest, like the original builder had brought sensibilities from outside to bring them in, and it was not compatible with this landscape. There, you see to the left and right of you art pieces that depict people. You can see individuals of different backgrounds, and you see one that appears to be of pure elven blood with brown hair, difficult to make out the gender, but beautiful and standing very robust with a chin out and a wily grin. Oils, very well done. To the left of you, you can see the other portrait appears to be a woman with a very well made dress with these large, almost puffs at the shoulders. It seems almost trying too hard to be aristocratic. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h32m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h32m47s">It's garish, but here you are. A moment later the door closes behind you, and you're still being flanked by this bevy of guards. You hear the heavy footsteps coming down the staircase. Turning the corner, you see a figure now, framed in what little of the light is coming through that window behind them. (footfalls) Stepping down you see a woman, dark-gray skin and ankle-length, black hair that is smooth and straight that falls behind her. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h32m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h32m47s">You see bony crests of horns that curve up into these two large points behind the head and bright yellow eyes that are pupil-less. A grin that shows two fanged canines. As she descends you can see her attire is very formal, colonial style coat with epaulets, but it seems to be tailored to not hide her figure. She already exudes an air of powerful aggression and presence. With each step that she takes down there, you can sense her immediately reading and seeing in and through each of you. Quietly she takes the last step to the landing here in the foyer. (German accent) "You bring tidings from The Gentleman, you say." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=2h32m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h0m44s">Okay. Under a branch, Frumpkin takes some of the low branches of these trees, underneath the canopy and gets a look. Through Frumpkin's eyes, you see what looks to be a black bear, but black bears that you've seen in passing before have been, maybe, eight feet, ten feet end to end. This one's closer to 15 and about ten feet to shoulder. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=3h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h0m44s">Its fur is long and matted, almost greasy in patches. At the shoulders and the elbows and ridges on its face, you see bone protrusions, like spikes. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=3h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You're still a good 100 or so feet away, using the trees at your disposal and you can see now the wall that matches the perimeter. It's a thin, five foot wide wall with a very flimsy rail across the top, but it is a walkway for watch guards to keep an eye out. As you glance at this distance, you can see one figure that's walking the perimeter of the top of the wall, with a heavy crossbow at the ready.

<dd id="l3h5m23s">It's pretty dense. The reason it took two hours to get there is because you're going through the forest. Otherwise on foot, in any sort of open scenario, it would take you half the time. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=3h5m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h5m40s">It looks there is manicured to be about a ten-foot distance between the wall and any of the surrounding trees, specifically to make sure that any sort of approaching individuals would be out in the open. You can see now a little bit of light is coming through. It looks like they've cleared out a bit of the canopy, not entirely, but a bit of it to also prevent any low-hanging boughs or branches to curl into the interior of the walls. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=3h5m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h5m40s">It's not a massive stronghold, it looks to be approximately a little larger than the Estate Sybaritic that you were at, but it's more for function than beautiful decor.

<dd id="l3h8m14s">After a minute or so, the guard just keeps looking out. Jumpy. From Frumpkin's view, down inside, you can see the exterior of this.

<dd id="l3h9m0s">22. Looking through these curved window ports about that big, essentially large enough to look through and fire through, but small enough to not really allow a person to push through. You can see there's about two inches of stone, so it is a stone structure that has wood as a decorated exterior to it, so it's pretty solid. Down inside, you do see about six horses that are hitched on the back side of it and two carts and a third one that is currently being repaired. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=3h9m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The smell of alcohol and stale, dried meat hits your nose and you can see immediately, sitting in two of the chairs, two members of The Iron Shepherds that are in the process of eating a midday lunch. One of them is a small male halfling. He has a weaselly-looking face. He's in the process of finishing what's comparatively to his size, a large tankard of ale, and eating some sort of heavy starch biscuit meal. Across from him, on the other side of the table, you see a human female barbarian with greasy curls of blondish hair that meet with her fur shoulder and very tattered leathers for decoration. They're both drinking and eating. Catching off the side of the ear, the halfling is seemingly mid-complaint about how, "You know, it really ticks me off that we lost some good catches on the way up here. Boss shouldn't've been so careless with that, but I mean, I'm not going to tell him that. You know, it's frustrating." The women finishes a bite and a big swig of her glass. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=p6miK4kIwIE&t=3h28m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
