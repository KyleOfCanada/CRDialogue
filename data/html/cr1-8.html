<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello and good evening, everyone. Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us voice-actors get together and play Dungeons and Dragons-- crazy, fun, nerdy times. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">So we are unfortunately missing Travis Willingham again this evening, because he's a pussy and had to go see Avengers tonight, so feel free to let him know on Twitter. But anyway, we have a really fun, action-packed adventure-- as if last week's wasn't tension enough. Let's see how the rest of the group manages to recover from their climactic battle at the top of Emberhold. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">But in the meantime, let's go ahead and give you an intro and some of the character backgrounds before we come back. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">[dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m43s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m43s">Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h1m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m43s">Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h1m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m43s">As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h1m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m43s">She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h1m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m43s">When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h1m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m43s">Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h1m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m46s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m46s">Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h3m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m46s">Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h3m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m46s">In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h3m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m46s">But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h3m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m46s">And his disobedience cost him dearly. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h3m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m46s">Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h3m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m46s">Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h3m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m46s">Also ale! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h3m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m33s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m33s">A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h5m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m33s">Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h5m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m33s">Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h5m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m33s">Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h5m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m33s">As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h5m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m38s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m38s">Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h7m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m38s">One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h7m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m38s">Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h7m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m38s">Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h7m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h8m52s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m52s">Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h8m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m52s">A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h8m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m52s">Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h8m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m52s">Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h8m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m52s">A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h8m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m52s">Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h8m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m52s">Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h8m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h10m13s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m13s">Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h10m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m13s">From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h10m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m13s">However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h10m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m13s">After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h10m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m13s">I found those answers to be unacceptable. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h10m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m13s">A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h10m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m13s">Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h10m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m12s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m12s">Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h12m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m12s">Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h12m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m12s">After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h12m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m12s">(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h12m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m12s">An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h12m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h13m42s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h13m42s">Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h13m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m42s">Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h13m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m42s">It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h13m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m42s">Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods; she preferred the isolation. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h13m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m42s">Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h13m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m42s">Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h13m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m6s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m6s">Hey guys, welcome back. While we are missing Travis, it's totally fine, Avengers is a fantastic film. It's a wonderful film and hope he doesn't spoil anything for us in his return, but he is missed. Travis, we miss you. We'll have you back next week, hopefully. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m21s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m21s">I'm going to spoil the movie for everybody: they win! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m25s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN, LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m25s">But do they? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m28s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m28s">I don't know. It's Joss Whedon (laughs) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m31s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m31s">I didn't say who 'they' were. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m33s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m33s">Oh, that's true. All right, so, welcome everyone. For those of you who's this the first time, (laughs) buckle up for some interesting-- So we're a bunch of voice actors who play Dungeons &amp; Dragons and this is our campaign we've been running for a while. To give you a little heads-up on the story so far, the party was hired to find an individual named Lady Kima, and she is a halfling paladin. The platinum dragon Bahamut is her deity <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m57s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m57s">And we found her! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m59s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m59s">You did. I was going to get to that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h15m59s">(all laugh) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h15m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h16m3s">So they went seeking her in caverns beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer. After much fighting and surviving, they manage to find their way to a duergar fortress called Emberhold, where they found Lady Kima captive beneath. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h16m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h16m3s">They released her and then, using her help, assaulted the throne room at the top and managed to slay King Murghol of the duergar. However, in the process, Grog, our intrepid barbarian, was kidnapped by the queen mage before she could be slain, who then also disintegrated a portion of the roof, letting an entire cavalcade of molten rock into the fortress. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h16m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h16m3s">The party then had to make a heated escape. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h16m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h16m3s">However, a number of the party members, due to the gaze of the two basilisks that were kept in the throne room as pets, Lady Kima and our Tiberius Stormwind, our dragonborn sorcerer, are currently stone. Dragging them out of the fortress as the magma began to fill the interior, a very deft escape was made, aside from Vax unfortunately getting his foot temporarily submerged in the lava, taking some serious damage to his foot. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h16m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h16m3s">The party manage to make their way outside of the Emberhold proper, and you've all taken a moment to breathe at this point, realizing that thankfully, for the most part, you've all survived. Aside from the missing party member and a few in a state of flux at the moment. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h16m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h16m3s">So, picking up there where we left off. You're all breathing heavily. The sincerity of the battle has just come over you. The adrenaline's still pumping through your system. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=0h16m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h17m34s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dd id="l1h6m0s">So, as you continue down this cavern, you begin to see the search parties in the distance and you keep low and watch as they pass. Some of them have small, that red glowish stone torches set out to keep their vision about. You can see a few of the parties returning to the city. Eventually, you guys begin to crest down deeper and dropping into a small decline as this giant, almost hatchback cavern where most of the duergar civilization is built in comes to an end. You begin to travel deeper, deeper into the Underdark caverns below. As you're continuing forward, you find a very very familiar scent catches your attention immediately, as you're tracking through, trying to keep your attention on possibly any sign of Grog. It's the smell of blood. It's the smell of fresh blood. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=1h6m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You immediately glance over and you can see on the side of this cavern, which is about 50, 60 feet wide at this point, as it's come to a pinching point leading downward, you can see a spatter of blood across the wall to your immediate left, and what looks like a mangled mass of what once was a duergar, currently just torn asunder across this rock wall. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=1h7m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You, however, just being naturally understanding of the Underdark, as well as having the previous knowledge of inspecting the initial camp: yes, these tracks are very similar. You see what looks like these strange dragging marks on the ground, these elongated ones. No footprints. Occasionally you see what looks like a human-sized footprint as well, and then these drag marks. You also notice that there is just beyond the rock threshold, as you step over towards the wall, you see three other duergar bodies that are torn asunder. Many of them partially eaten and violently torn apart. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=1h7m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Its very thin and gaunt legs dangling as four giant, jagged-looking tentacles sprout from both sides of its torso, holding it aloft. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=1h34m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h34m44s">Two lifting it off the ground and keeping its body suspended, while two are (fwhoosh) whipping around in the process. As you're glancing, you see its head (cracking noise) glance up toward the wall. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=1h34m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h34m44s">These blank, white eyes shooting around in different directions spontaneously, with this maddening look. Whatever this is is clearly insane and is currently driven on some sort of hunger bloodlust. The stitch marks you see across its body are very reminiscent of the earlier abominations that you saw, created by K'varn and sent throughout this cavern structure. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=1h34m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You can see there's a semblance of clothing on it. Whatever this thing once was, it's still wearing the clothing it had and a portion of it has burned off part of the torso.

<dd id="l1h46m6s">Okay, so it takes a total of nine points of damage. Crushing damage from the blow of the stone on top of it. Nice. As it (crssh) shrugs off bits of chunks of stone that are around its body, you can see a little bit of blood is being pulled to the seams of its body. It's taken some hits. It's still doing all right but it's definitely-- you can see it's not impervious by any means. That brings us to Vax. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=1h46m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As she comes down and slams it with the big sword twice, the first one arcing down with divine energy, streaking across the barely-lit cavernous area. It hits the ground, and it splatters blood across. You can see one of its tentacles is barely hanging on by just a section of muscle and sinew.

As it does there's just plumes of dust that are being cast in the air behind you guys. You cough a little bit as it's lifting the small spray of dust. You begin to make your way across this open field of bone and glass to the other side, finding for the first time in a little bit of time solid stone ground. You all take a moment and gather your breath, and as you're taking a moment, you look over and you can see in the darkness ahead of you what looks to be a faint source of light around another large pillar or cluster of stone in the distance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=2h48m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Not used for light, but apparently used for cooking as the scent also hits you.

<dd id="l2h50m19s">It smells pretty good. You're not quite sure what the source of the meat is. You worry for a second because you see the two duergar that are sitting there, currently holding the meat in the center of this, are staying next to a giant troll who has his hand on the side of a rickety wooden cart. On this cart, which you can see, there are two sets of wheels on each side, there is a large lumbering goliath individual currently held down with bands of iron. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=2h50m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h50m19s">Your mind for second thinks, "Oh god, are they eating him?" but you see he appears to be intact, though with a quick glance as you peer around the other side of the stone column, you can see his body is riddled with scratches and small wounds and incisions, and you can see where streaks of dried blood are across his entire body. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=2h50m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

One of the tents opens up and you see a duergar female step out: silver circlet across her forehead, long robes. Queen Ulara walks up and starts talking to the other duergar, pointing to your goliath friend, to Grog, on the front of this. Motions to the other two and steps back into the tent, closing it behind her as the two other duergar grin. One reaches into his pouch and begins to pull out small, looks like metal hooked utensils, possibly to go in for another round of whatever they'd been doing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=A14MzQxxdwM&t=2h51m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
