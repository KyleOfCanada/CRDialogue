<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m7s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m7s">We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h0m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m9s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m9s">We are already in top form tonight, if you couldn't tell. Before we go ahead and jump into our story, let's go ahead and get through some announcements for the evening. First, we have two wonderful sponsors tonight, beginning with our friends, who have continued through the first part of this campaign and to the new year, D&amp;D Beyond. Sam? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h0m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m27s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m27s">D&amp;D Beyond! Is the camera on me? I can't tell. It is on me! D&amp;D Beyond, everybody. Last week we kicked off my campaign to become president of D&amp;D Beyond. That campaign will continue through a lot of the year. We have lots of big things planned, but the campaign is taking a week off this week. Instead, I spent most of this week making an infomercial for our good friends at D&amp;D Beyond. I shot, I edited it, I added music. It's a really cool piece. It talks about all the great features of D&amp;D Beyond, how it streamlines game-play, and you should all go subscribe to it right now at dndbeyond.com. Anyway, I made this infomercial. I'm going to give it to Max right now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h0m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m11s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m11s">I am so nervous right now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h1m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m12s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m12s">He's going to pop it up there and play it. I think you guys will like it. I'm an <i>auteur</i>, so don't be too critical. Whenever it's loaded up, Max, take it away. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h1m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m12s">(muffled, singing the D&amp;D Beyond theme song) Okay, that was not the right video. Sorry about that. That was a technical glitch, Max; that was not the right one. You know what, play the next video on the thumb drive. I'm sure it's the next one down in the folder, so go ahead and hit play on-- the next video will probably be the one. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h1m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m12s">Kids, kids, let me in. Let me in the house. Kids, this isn't funny. Kids? Okay, no, this is embarrassing. You know what, Max, it's probably not that folder. Try the other folder, the one labeled "Sam awesome stuff". Try that folder on the thumb drive and play-- I'm auditioning for the role of Joel on the movie-- the video game Last on Us? Last on Us. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h1m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m12s">(clears throat) Take one. (high-pitched) Ellie, do you realize what your life means, running off like that? No, Max, no! It's "Sam awesome stuff 2019", not "Sam awesome stuff 2012". That was the wrong folder! Go to the one marked 2019 and play that one. Come on, Max, get it right. Play it! Hey, Liam. I'm waiting. When you get home tonight, I might be asleep, but it's okay. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h1m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m12s">Wake me up, okay? (kiss noise) Love you, baby. Bye. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h1m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m7s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m7s">(screaming) I'm sorry, that was not supposed to be for the public. That was something that I sexted to Liam. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h3m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m7s">It was not supposed to be released. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h3m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m20s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m20s">The video that I made, it talked about how affordable D&amp;D Beyond is, how you can get your content, your guides, your campaign guides, all in one place. There's content for DMs and players. It really makes the whole process great. You know what, I think it would be safe to play all the rest of the videos. Go ahead and play all of the rest of the videos. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h3m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m0s">Now that I'm thinking about it, I think that was the other thumb drive that I left at home, and I think this one-- Max, I apologize. I think this one's on me, so I apologize, and I apologize to D&amp;D Beyond. Please subscribe now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h4m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m48s">Sam is not doing this next intro. As for our second sponsor tonight, our friends at Idle Champions. For those who aren't familiar with Idle Champions-- Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms is the full name of it. It's a D&amp;D strategy video game that brings a variety of popular D&amp;D characters together for the first time in one world. You can play it on PC, Steam and mobile, iPad and Android, but apparently now it's available on Xbox and PS4, which is awesome. You have characters from Drizzt of the Forgotten Realms all the way up to Arkhan, who you saw-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h4m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m54s">The new creative series featuring art lessons from our fantastic friend of the family, Babs Tarr. She teaches Marisha and then other members of the extended family how to draw. And you as well, as you follow along and do your own artwork. Between the Sheets is coming back very soon. The first episode of season two of Between the Sheets airs on Monday January 28th and 7:00pm Pacific here at twitch.tv/criticalrole. It's going to be awesome. This whole next season's awesome, so look forward to that. January 18th to the 20th, this weekend-- tomorrow! Saturday and Sunday, at Gallery Nucleus in Los Angeles, we have the Art of Exandria art show. We've been wanting to do an art show for so long, it's our first time actually being able to get it done! We saw pictures today; the setup looks amazing. Over 50 pieces of art from our fantastic Critter community will be on display there. If you're in the area, come check it out, hang out, run into other Critters. It looks to be a lot of fun this weekend, so hope to see you guys there. For more details on that, you can go to critrole.com/events. Then on January 19th, this Saturday, we're bringing back most of Vox Machina for our Search for Grog live show here in Los Angeles. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h5m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You then exited back to your ship, which another ship was found to be giving chase, apparently notified by your presence from the large geyser that erupted from the ocean due to the unsealing. A short chase then commenced, leading to a much shorter battle. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h10m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h21m20s">Who's going to the blacksmith? Team blacksmith, you begin to wander through the streets, asking questions around. Eventually, some of the local zhelezo lead you over to the place called Ingots and Hammers. It seems to be a humble size, but this isn't a very big smithing town, necessarily. In fact, one of them you speak to goes like, "Port Zoon would be more the place to "go if you're looking for good, brawny blacksmiths, but there is Ingots and Hammers, maybe." They head you over in that direction. The exterior of it, most of it the heavy stone base of the building-- it's a standard rectangle, most of it open on the side facing the street so you can see the smoke from the forge itself pouring out. It doesn't have a specific chimney built more than it billows out in two places to create these two drifting streams that head up. As you walk up, you can see there isn't immediately work being done. It looks like perhaps there is a mid-afternoon break, and you do see a tan skinned, heavyset, burly looking fellow, human, smooth bald head, a split lip that healed back and it has this big scar piece that gives him a little bit of character, and he sits there in the middle of eating a bowl of fruit and glances up at you. "Hello? Can I help you?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=0h21m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Sets it down and rummages through a small shelf unit in the back and pulls out a few books and pulls out one tome, opens it up and sets it down and begins thumbing through, page to page. Takes about five, six minutes to find something before he stops and goes, "My apologies. This is not really a form of "forging that I can repair.

If you're watching it, which I imagine you probably were, as you were heading through the Open Quay, it's pretty immediate, meaning within about 500 feet or so the transition really hits. From any distance in the city it just looks like any other large tower, though it looks like one of the more visible and apparent ones across the skyline.

<dd id="l1h42m59s">All right. As you begin that process, you hear the soft footsteps beginning to descend the stairs, and there you see the figure come down. It is a male elf, light-brown, tan skin. The hair is short-- cut very short in the back, and it curls up into this side wave. Jet-- not jet. Jet-white is not a thing. Stark white hair, and very chiseled features, but you can see the crow's nest wrinkles coming in. From what elves you've seen, this is a very old elf. Of what age begins to come through, there are a lot of years on this elf. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=1h42m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h42m59s">Shorter than most elves that you've seen, probably comes to about maybe five feet, maybe a little under that.

<dd id="l3h2m26s">Okay. As you approach the city, the people here go about their business per normal, though it does look like there is a presence of Righteous Brand soldiers, maybe a hundred or so that have been stationed here on top of the crownsguard. The crownsguard were here before, and you see Righteous Brand patrolling the major ins and outs and doing passes around the vicinity. General protection to this city has been increased in the presence of this war. You approach the city and ask around. Bryce is both available, though looking a bit harried. They approach. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=3h2m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Anyway, in crossing the bridge to cross the Eistus River, cresting the hills before it, you can already see the low haze of gray and brown that's gently fading over the region. As you reach the peak and look down upon the familiar sight of the once-green farmland that you had passed by when you were heading north toward Shadycreek Run, you can already see a fair patch of the Tillage lies black and ashen. Probably a quarter of it. As you begin to make your way towards the outskirts of the city, you can already see small squadrons of Righteous Brand patrolling the fields. I mean, a dozen small squadrons of about 50 soldiers each. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ozSrsj6TtKc&t=3h10m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
