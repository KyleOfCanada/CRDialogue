<dd id="l0h0m1s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where Taliesin jumps the gun and says his phrase too late. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h0m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m10s">Welcome. Happy to be back. Very emotional episode last week. We're going to kick it into the next step of Vox Machina's adventure this week, and then, me, Marisha, and Taliesin will be gone next week, so there will not be progression in this current storyline. However, Liam O'Brien over there has been cracking up an awesome one-shot adventure for our remaining players and a few guests. Liam, if you want to talk a little about it? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h0m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m33s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m33s">Yeah, I'll tell you who's coming on by. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h0m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m33s">Sure, I'll say who's coming on by. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Ashly Burch. And I don't want to spoil it, but Matt knows. It's different. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h0m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m48s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h0m58s">I think you'll be fine. If the last game was any indication, I think you'll be fine. All right, other announcements: once again, we have our wonderful sponsor with a new theme kicking in. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h0m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m58s">Sam, you want to take this away? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h0m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m14s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m14s">Yes, I do, Matt Mercer. Guys: Loot Crate. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m14s">Loot Crate has been such a great sponsor all year long, and we got another great week to share with you. Speed is this month's theme of the Loot Crate. I'm going to read this script first. Lace up your sneakers or rev your engines. September's all about speed. Feel the adrenaline with some of pop culture's quickest vehicles and characters. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m14s">High-octane assortment of goodies from Batman, the Flash, the Arrow, the Battlestar Galactica, the Iron Man, the Gone in the Sixty the Seconds. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m52s">It includes two collectibles, a figure, and as always, a monthly t-shirt. I'm wearing a t-shirt. Not from this month, but from last month. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m59s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m59s">Guys, I'm an actor. Why would you listen to me about this stuff? I'm a liar and a deceiver. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m59s">But what you can listen to, and what you know in your heart, is hardcore facts. I'm talking statistics. I'm talking math. I've broken this down for you guys. If you use the promo-code CriticalRole, you'll get $3 off your first month. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m59s">Doesn't sound like a lot, you think? Oh, that's 1.2 gallons of gas at the Quik Mart down the street. Regular, unleaded. Or let's say you're generous. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your family. That's four Loot Crates; that's $12. That is 25 and half Forever stamps that you've just gotten for free. For free! Let's say you're more generous than that. You give Loot Crates to everyone in your whole company. All 266 employees. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m59s">You've just saved enough money to buy a 2002 Kia Sedona with 181,000 miles on it. The transmission is going out, and it doesn't shift in the higher gears, but it is for $800 on Craigslist. Go look for it right now, and it will be yours for free, essentially, if you buy 266 subscriptions to Loot Crate. 266.67. Okay, that is <i>hardcore facts.</i> You can't argue with that. Go out. Subscribe now. Save money. Get stamps and gas. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h1m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m32s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m40s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m40s">Perfect. (laughs) All right, other announcements that we have. Let's see. Projects that have come up. They recently announced and put up the English cast video for Final Fantasy XV. I have the pleasure of playing Cor Leonis. It's a lot of fun. As a longtime Final Fantasy fan, being a part of this means a great deal, and I'm excited for the game that comes out in November. So if you haven't checked out the video, do so and you can watch me wax poetic briefly about my love of the series. Look forward to that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h3m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m11s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m19s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m19s">It's like I played a bunch of them. Also, Deus Ex came out. Mankind Divided. I am scattered throughout the game with a very harsh Russian, Eastern European dialect, as many characters, probably yelling at you or being shot in the face. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h4m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m19s">So enjoy that, as well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h4m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m59s">Yes! In the world of sportsball, the 2016 future Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys are playing the Seattle Seahawks right now! So if you see me looking down, it's not because I'm not paying attention. I'm watching football. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h5m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m51s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m51s">All righty. That being the case, then let's go ahead and hop into tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h6m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m51s">[dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h6m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m26s">Hello, and welcome back. So to get you guys caught up: our band of adventurers, Vox Machina, in raising an army, hopefully, of allies and powerful artifacts to face the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of powerful, dangerous chromatic dragons that have been tearing through the countryside of Tal'Dorei and distant Wildemount. They have recently found some information, had a close call with the Frigid Doom known as Vorugal. The white dragon flyover did not pierce through the illusionary barrier that was placed with the help of Allura, Gilmore, and Pike, there in Whitestone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m26s">You then decided to go ahead and using that cue, before the dragon returned to its current roost that it has created over the ruins of the city of Draconia, you traveled across to the continent of Wildemount. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m26s">You had a meeting with the Ravenites, a rather subverted, long-enslaved offshoot species of dragonborn kin, tailless and now surviving amongst a recent winter that seems to have come with the ruin the dragon brought. You also discovered that most of Draconia and its royal elite have been slaughtered as a means of the dragon establishing its dominance and the worship of the Ravenites that survived the fall of Draconia. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m26s">You made a deal with Tooma, the current clan leader of the remaining Ravenites, that you would aid in destroying this dragon, basically the master that they replaced the Draconians with when it came. However, to ensure your help there was a two-week time limit, and if you do not return before then they would see you as not keeping your end of the deal, and they would then, instead, direct the dragon towards what was going to be Whitestone until you altered her memory, which she recalls now as Emon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m26s">Anyway, before you could be finding your way home, one of the corpses upon one of the ice spire spikes outside of the dragon's new nest, Percy saw to be the remains of your long-traveled friend, Tiberius Stormwind. The party had a fateful farewell; set him to rest within the ruins of the nearby library, fallen from the islands of Draconia; said your goodbyes; and then, upon prepping a bit, plotting, and planning, found your way back to Whitestone to continue the next leg of your adventure. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m26s">And that is where we begin. You have now taken some time in your own respective rooms. It's still late afternoon, going into dusk. You all took some time to yourselves within Castle Whitestone to take a short rest and ruminate over these recent events and reveals. The evening sun draws close to dusk. It is your choice which you wish to do. If you wish to spend the evening resting here and then leaving first thing in the morning, that is up to you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h8m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m29s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m29s">Taking the initiative. This one came to my room, then inside. I think we've probably been quiet for a while, staring at the ceiling, and after a while finally say: We've really fucked things up, haven't we? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h11m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m55s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m55s">In which particular way do you mean, aside from all of them? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h11m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m1s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m1s">I need to tell you. I know with all that's happened, between my new patron and my sister pretending to gag literally every time we attempt to share a word together, and mostly my own being fucked up in the head for weeks now, that I've pushed all of you away. You most of all. Because I've been afraid you would-- I'm sorry. And you didn't deserve any of that. Keyleth, I need you to know, through all of that, everything, nothing has changed about how I-- We've had so many near-misses. And now, finding Tiberius. Death is unavoidable. And it's all the more reason for life to be lived. And it doesn't matter to me what this is. What we call it. If you are willing to spend some time, any time, with me, then I will simply count myself lucky to have it. You're very dear to me. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h12m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h14m28s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h14m28s">You're talking too much. It's not like I've made myself very accessible either. It's not on you. It might be a little on you, but it's on both of us. Anyway, my point is: for the longest time, I was terrified that I was going to lose you. First to death and then to the Raven Queen, which is still kind of like death, and then ultimately to yourself. And then I had an interesting talk with Pike recently, and she said something that really stood out to me, and that was that some people just have more of themselves to give. And I realized this whole time that I was afraid of losing you to a future that ultimately has not yet been written, which is stupid. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h15m55s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h15m55s">Maybe so. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=0h15m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You hear faint music in the distance; it sounds like some sort of a piano being played. No accompaniment, just a straight piano. You hear distant whispers of conversation, the occasional burst of laughter, and you can see the edge of Kaylie's elbow, leaning against the edge of the table. There's a long pause, no movement. Then all of a sudden, she shifts back from the table and goes, "That's right, all the money on the table's mine. Nice try." Scoops down, throwing her hand of cards on the table. You hear a couple voices go (groaning). You see her scoop the coins over and go place them into a coin bag. "All right, so perhaps another round, then?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=1h13m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You see appear into view the very edge of Dr. Dranzel's chin and hat and he goes, "I'm "sorry, were you talking to my lady friend that way? That's poor manners."

The other hand he reaches back into a small pouch on his side and pulls out a small amount of shimmering, glassy sand material you recognize as a hint of residuum processed into its dust crystallized form. He scatters it around while he's muttering under his breath. As he does, with his hand in the center, you see the dust pull together into these small symbols on their own, almost like magnets to iron filings. They're forming into these rigid structures. As they do, they begin to flare up and glow, and he takes a step back, his eyes still closed, brings his fist together into a grip. As he does, they light up, and you recognize this as a teleportation circle. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=1h17m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h20m34s">You glance through the cloth, and it looks like it is a glass window, but it is partially opened and looks like there's a little cluster of sand that's gathered over time underneath the sill, from what little bit the wind's pushed through. Glancing out as soon as you push out, the light is very bright, and you have to take a moment for your eyes to adjust. Looking out, you see a simple street. There are some small buildings built of fine wood; nothing too extravagant. You can see a number of trees that protrude from the sand: long, tall, thin, palm frond-type tops to them, bearing some sort of large nut-like fruit. You can see what look to be small troughs of gathered water, whether it be from rain or them placed there intentionally, but they're currently locked with some semi-translucent top and chained shut, on the outside of two of the buildings. You do see a few people walking back up and down the street. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=1h20m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You can see where lots of it, from a recent rain, have caked and hardened and then broken in places. It leaves this soft, shale-type texture to it that breaks into sand upon crumbling underfoot. From what you can see, there are a number of various heights of dunes in the distance. This city is thrown right in the center of what appears to be hundreds of miles of desert from the view that you had as the sun was setting. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=1h42m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Amongst the carved-out circle of caravan carts and people that are camping overnight before entering the city, you do see what appear to be a dozen guards, all dressed in dark blue and dark reddish metallic armor, many carrying heavy scimitars to their side or long pikes and shields. They're all wearing intricate helmets that crest down past the nose to the point where it looks like they just have eyes and a lower jaw. It flares out at the bottom and then curves to a point right across where the clavicle would be. The armor itself is designed in a very beautiful ornate fashion, but also looks very functional. You're at a distance; they don't seem to have noticed you as you've all crested down still in your cloud forms. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=1h44m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There are a few campfires that have been set up by the caravans that are waiting amongst the sand and broken ground there. They give a little more light. As you guys get to the outskirts of this, your shapes becoming visible to those that are keeping watch, you see a few individuals stand up on their carts with their crossbows at the ready. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=1h49m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You guys exit, find yourself on the exterior walls of Ank'Harel, the sun blazing down in the early morning, a hotter temperature than you've been used to in quite some time. Would be the equivalent of probably the low 100s Fahrenheit by our standards. All of you with layers of armor, which is all of you except for Grog, immediately feel this is going to be uncomfortable fairly quickly. Grog, you are used to higher colder climates, even without being heavily armored, still fairly uncomfortable. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h10m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It's a city of vibrant color; you see nearly every home, storefront, and outhouse has some form of draping silks or painted mural to give it individual character, standing out against the rest of its neighboring abodes, creating a calming, beautiful symphony of really nothing, in the presentation of it all.

<dt><a href="#l2h24m54s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l2h24m54s">All right. As you guys continue deeper into the city, the sheer size of this town reminds you of a mirror universe form of Emon, in the way that the streets narrow and then open, and the liveliness of culture around you in its heyday, and it saddens you, because it reminds you of back when the city was at its prime, when you first arrived and made it a home for yourself. But at the same time, the energy is infectious, and you can't help but feel like there's a lot of interesting people, culture, and momentum all about you no matter where you seem to walk across these streets. Though the culture here appears to be far older than that of Emon that you've encountered; even the buildings and constructs range in ways that-- maybe not as old as Vasselheim, per se, but at least you can see that there's some variation to some of the abodes here that have been worn through time more so than any you have encountered in Tal'Dorei, for the most part. These decorated and intricate buildings fill the streets. You can see pride in their construction, and the smells of horses and hot desert air combine with various burning spice and sage that occasionally wafts through the air to your nostrils. The ever-changing exotic skyline occasionally grabs your attention. You see the distant shadow of what looks like a skyship docked at a sky port. You get looks of many citizens, expressions ranging from amusement to mistrust as you pass by, until you come upon a massive building that shines with the sunlight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h24m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h24m54s">Above you, you see a number of red flags that hang and drift, about five feet in length, these thin, draping pieces of silk that shift with the breeze, and you can see numbers of these strands across different roads, and it's at this point that you look up and realize that this is the entrance to the Suncut Bazaar. Looking off towards the left, and what you've been watching as you approach, there are this cluster of dark blue and purple towers of various widths marking a central place in the center of the city. In the center of them, there is one very large, cylindrical tower that rises up past them all into what looks like a chalice or a cup-like platform at the very top that is impossibly high amongst the rest of the structures here in the city. It seems to be a beacon or watchtower over the entirety of Ank'Harel. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h24m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h24m54s">But your attention now, here in the Suncut Bazaar, as you step around the corner, you can see tents and storefronts and buildings and voices raised as different barkers are shouting out for their wares. You can see carts being drawn through the streets by horse and camel. You can see what appear to be dozens upon dozens of people coming through with small satchels and coming by and purchasing their necessities for the day. You can smell cooking meats and food in the distance. You can see street performers juggling, and distant music of buskers in the side of the street, playing various flutes and instruments: some you recognize, some you do not. You actually see a shawm. It catches your attention on the side of the street. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h24m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h28m39s">Most people you come around here, it seems a largely human population. Beyond that, you've not seen a single dwarf as you've walked through the city, but you have seen a number of dark-skinned halflings, a few half-elves. Not an elf has caught your eye since you've wandered through. You've seen a couple of tieflings that walk openly in this city, which is a rare thing from Emon. Even there, most tieflings generally are met with mistrust and prejudice in the street. Here, no one seems to pay mind or bother. You do see a few half-orcs, this team of half-orcs that are shouting out in a language that none of you understand. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h28m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h28m39s">Some sort of sales pitch they're giving, and there's a few people gathered around them. This is a very wide variety of people that live in this city, and everyone seems to mesh together without issue or prejudice, but not one goliath has caught your eye, and you've caught the eyes of many. And wherever you walk, you can see the townspeople stop, and they don't gawk. They don't stare intently. They're more curious, but no one appears to be following you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h28m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h30m3s">There are a few that appear to go into buildings, but the majority of this, as you look at now the Suncut Bazaar itself, while it is a section of the city, it is mostly open sky and is probably hundreds of various tents, carts, pop-up stand-ups, and even the center of the street, blankets set out, with the various merchants there with their wares strewn across the ground, waiting for anybody to come and approach. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=2h30m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It is not a delightful flavor, and as the tongue goes numb, the back of the throat goes numb as you swallow. As the numbness continues down the rest of the body, the flavor has not improved at all, but it brings this universal numbness. And as the slight pain of the burn subsides, you, with just but a few sips, become extremely intoxicated, but also just numb. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h12m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You leap over, keeping in the shadow, and give chase down that way. You turn around underneath the bridge and you can see underneath the bridge, there is an archway that leads into a dark path down an actual hallway beneath the series of buildings you just saw ahead of you.

You can just see the dark outline as it darts forward and then leaps off again, down the right past that exit. You follow, and you look off the side just as you see the figure slink behind one large crate next to a storage section outside of a warehouse. It ducks behind another one. Darts up to a building that looks to be shuttered and closed. It looks like a furniture store with a little sign at the top that says, "A Kingly Home." It moves an empty rain barrel to the side and slips the leather case through a hole that was previously hidden by the barrel, dropping it inside the building, slides the barrel over it again.

<dd id="l3h55m31s">So you guys are making your way towards the Cerulean Palace. As you approach the large, extremely imposing palace, you come upon what looks to be an endless series of stairs that brings you to the upper platform that is the central portion of the city where the palace seems to reside, eventually peaking in the Sandherald district that you were referred to earlier as the location of the palace and where the Bowl of Judgment exists. You step up to the very top of the stairs to find yourself already breathless at the sight of the immense purple-blue-colored palace. A dozen towers reach for the clouds, the daylight peeking through their slightly translucent material, like glassy waters ever-frozen in a fall. The central tower, the one that caught your eye, that ends in a large cup-like position, rises above all of them with a slight spiral-type texture to the outside of the palace that is incredibly tall amongst the rest of the cityscape. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h55m31s">As you get closer, you can see the main palace structure presents hundreds of arches pointed at their apex in its structure, smaller and smaller as it recesses further into the palace. Its very architectural build is a marvel, and seems to both have consistency and a chaotic feel to the placement of some of these arches too, in size. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h55m31s">It's a very strange but fascinating structure. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h55m31s">You can also see turquoise detailing and trim against many of the pillars and carvings and statues that adorn the exterior of the grounds of this palace. As you approach what appear to be the front gates that ascend, with a very bright blue turquoise exterior, close to 50 Hands of Ord patrol various elements of the grounds around it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h55m31s">It looks like there are actual pockets of grass and gardens that exist around the Cerulean Palace in here. The topography changes almost to feel like it belongs entirely anywhere but the middle of the desert. The guards do eye you suspiciously as you approach, and you watch as one armored woman, her dark hair hidden mostly beneath an ornate helmet of brass and blue, approaches you guys. "Welcome to the Cerulean Palace. I must ask "your business here." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h55m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h59m3s">24. "Let me inquire with the Grand Maven." She turns around, her armor clinking, and walks back to the palace, leaving you guys there amongst these courtyard grounds. A few moments pass before she returns, the doors opening. As she descends, next to her you see an older woman with these long, ceremonial robes that drag behind her, spilling across the stairs as she descends, seemingly dozens of gemmed bracelets that jingle as she walks with each step. She wears a tall headdress with what looks like brass quills that press behind her head and down her back. As she approaches you all, the woman earlier that you spoke to, the Hand that approached you, stays behind quietly and watches, weapon at the ready. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h59m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h59m3s">The woman steps forward with a smile, and unlike the abrasive appearance that most of the Hand have given, she seems to be more welcoming, and gives, for the first time since you've been here, a very formal welcoming bow with her hand before her, the other hand out. Says, "Be pleased, everyone." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=3h59m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

From the interior, massive pointed archways that lead down ornately decorated halls that echo with each footfall that hits across what looks like endless white and black bespeckled marble. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h0m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h0m40s">She leads you through a series of hallways, more Hands walking past, as well as a number of other robed individuals.

<dd id="l4h5m37s">You walk into what is a cylindrical chamber of smooth blue-purple quartz-like material with four strands of heavy chains taut between the ceiling and floor, about 15 feet above you. No other exit. You all enter and the door closes behind you, the Maven still relaxing, her arms to her side, her headdress still giving her this ominous presence. Looks up, and there's a (impact) shuddering sound. Suddenly, the bland, uncharacteristic walls, compared to the rest of the palace, begin to slide past the chains, now making this rattling sound as the floor itself seems to be lurching. You feel a bit of pressure in the room that wasn't there before. You're all being lifted, and the walls, now no longer walled in by the rest of the palace, you can now see this occasional traveling-down line as the spiral on the outside of the tower you once saw now surrounds you. The walls are much thinner than the rest of the palace, as you can see through this somewhat-translucent glass exterior the entirety of Emon surrounding you from upon high as it goes lower and lower as you're lifted higher and higher into this tower. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h5m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l4h6m57s">It's very off-putting, but beautiful at the same time. Everything's seen through this shimmering, somewhat-refracted blue passage. As you go higher and higher, you can see the countless homes, walls, and towers getting smaller and smaller, other towers eventually ending as you go higher in the tower. The Maven says, "I request you do not touch the walls, please." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h6m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l4h7m28s">The view reveals the entirety of the city around you, and beyond that, the distant dunes and the desert that seems to have no end. You view a far-off mountainscape a little bit in the northern direction that just begins to peek past your view, then (boom) the floor ceases again. You all seem to lurch for a moment, yourself, an inch before you catch yourself on your feet. The Maven catches herself, very used to this transition. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h7m28s">You now see behind her, where it has stopped, there is another set of doors, similar to the ones you entered from in the bottom portion of this tower. The door opens, (creak) and you can see the next room is a set of staircases of the same color that slowly curl off and disappear upward above you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h7m28s">"Please, follow me." She walks in, her robe dragging behind her. You guys give enough berth for it to follow. As you're led up the stairway, choosing right or left, they both lead to the upper platform in what is the top of the central tower of the Cerulean Palace. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h7m28s">As you enter this room, you see close to a hundred dangling silk tapestries from 50 or 60 feet up of multitudes of different colors; rainbowscapes of beautiful translucent cloths and silks, gently flowing with breezes and mingling and mixing into each other around the outside of the wall. High arched windows on each side, and behind, what looks to be a large opening reveals passing clouds surrounding this height and obfuscating certain portions as they meet with the height of this tower's apex. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h7m28s">You see a large balcony from the opposite side of the room that is opened from its own similar-sized arch that extends outward. It has a railing about four feet up that is an opening that overlooks in open air all above the city to see. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h7m28s">In the center of the chamber, you see a series of step-like platforms, circular, that rise up upon each other, and in the center, you see what seems to be a tall throne of bronze and sapphire that probably sits ten feet up from the base. Thin, but extremely long and widens towards the top. You can see hundreds of sapphires put into and set into this shiny, ruddy metallic material that frames the entirety of the throne. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h7m28s">And there sitting atop this throne, you see a slender, human-like entity wearing no jewelry, no ceremonial adornments, no crown, just a simple brown cotton shirt over simple, elegant pants. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l4h7m28s">Bare feet, no shoes. Androgynous and beautiful; you're unable to make out the sex of this creature. It's not a man, nor elf. Not fey, but something somewhat alien, almost. The skin a deep-set reddish brown, smooth and impeccable. The features are extremely fine and delicate. The eyes are what catch you: black like night, but the pupils, burning points of molten metal. The entity smiles and stands off the throne. Now, at this height, seeing it standing almost as tall as Grog, by comparison. The limbs are elongated. Extends a hand towards you as you step into the chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=6-Od2lnsiHs&t=4h7m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
