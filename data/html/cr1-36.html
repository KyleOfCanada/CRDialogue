<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone and good evening. Welcome to Critical Role, a show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. This will be our final episode for the year before we take our holiday break, and for those of you who aren't currently in the theater to see Star Wars or are not planning to leave in the next five minutes to go see Star Wars, which we do not begrudge you that whatsoever; many of us will be rushing off after this to do the same. For those of you staying with us, thank you for kicking it and may the Force be with you when this is over. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">So before we get started, let's go ahead and get a few announcements out of the way. One, for those of you who have been waiting extensively, because I know you have been. Tomorrow, on the website you will have the Snugglelord playlist will be premiering on GeekandSundry.com. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m54s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m54s">(laughs) The next announcement, we had our Critmas article go up earlier this week, our Critter's Guide to Critmas, where we each talk about the different charities that we represent and if you want to try and give something to the show and the goodwill we put out for that, it's a really great way to see what each of us would like to see presented or supported by the community. So if you haven't had a chance, go check it out and feel some holiday spirit to give, go ahead and pick any that are there or any of your own charities and do what you can to help. So, appreciate that guys. Also, the most recent comic went live for our Winter's Crest festival. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h0m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m58s">(laughs) Yeah, so go check it out, it's a lot of fun and plays into our Winter's Crest festival this evening, though that one took place a year ago in game technically. Two years, I guess, in game-- no, it was a year because the original-- and all the events that transpired after that, there was the make-up Winter's Crest festival. You don't know what we're talking about, but you may soon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h1m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h7m9s">Let's do this. Bring it in. So, to get you guys up to speed quickly, for those of you who are coming in fresh. Oh, what an episode to jump into. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h7m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m9s">So, the intrepid group of adventurers known as Vox Machina had made their way to the city of Whitestone, a town that Percival here grew up in and had taken from him and his family five years ago, most of his family, the de Rolos, being murdered in the process. The Briarwoods, who had taken the town rather quickly and covertly held it for five years had now been building toward some sort of a ritual, some sort of event that the party was investigating. They incited a rebellion within the city of Whitestone, gathering the remaining members to take up arms and fight against this undead scourge that had kept them locked down for so long, oppressed for so long. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h7m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m9s">After managing to take out some of the various operatives under the Briarwoods' regime, they made their way into Castle Whitestone itself, saved Percy's sister, Cassandra, thought dead for a long time, got vengeance upon a number of individuals that were on his List, except for Ripley, who got away. Fought their way down underneath the city of Whitestone, fell into an acid-based trap, made their way to the ziggurat, this construct beneath the city of Whitestone, where some ritual was attempting to be completed by Lady Delilah Briarwood. It was discovered that the patron they spoke of, the Whispered One, had been in previous bits of history spoken as Vecna, a powerful lich of ancient history that had attempted to ascend to godhood at some point in the past. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h7m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m9s">They managed to tackle the Briarwoods, destroy Sylas, defeat Delilah, and dragging them back, decided to interrogate. In the process of trying to extract information, Percy's dark harbinger, his dark passenger, if you will... who was a tongue-waggling dog for a moment. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h7m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h9m22s">Pressured to incite the vengeance that apparently the pact he made with this entity required. Upon fighting its will, it was jettisoned from his form and the party battled this deranged greater smoke demon-like entity in the center of this cavern. During this fight, Lady Briarwood tried to escape, however, found a dagger in the middle of her back, thanks to Vax over there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h9m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h9m45s">Stripped of her possessions, and then Cassandra dragging her into the nearby acid baths, tossing her body within to leave her story to a definite conclusion. Scanlan, being very astute, apparently, in some observations, and as convincing as he can be, managed to wrestle Percy's weapon, his List, his Pepperbox, from his grip, and tossed it into the very acid pits, destroying his greatest creation and in doing so, seemingly breaking whatever hold this shadow demon had on Percy's soul. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h9m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m34s">Upon returning to the city of Whitestone, they found the rebellion was successful. The undead hordes had fallen to the blades of the surviving rallying warriors of Whitestone.

You guys were brought to the center of town, where you began to see the rest of Whitestone emerge: the families, the children, the people that had been too scared to go outside finally came out to celebrate victory, the first real breath of free air they've had in five years since the Briarwoods took the city. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h10m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You come by, eagerly lifting, carrying, dropping, slamming, and holding in place extremely heavy pieces of stone and masonry. In some cases, putting a few of the local strong men to shame and some of the local ladies, very blush-worthy in your presence. You are very happy.

<dd id="l0h26m25s">He currently works in the stables on the far southwest side of town. But people have seen some of his work and tried to bolster him, so you're sent in his direction and as you get there, you can see him. He's currently in the process of actually cutting through one of his recent works he wasn't happy with and he's violently tearing through it. As you step into the stable, he stops and puts it off to the side. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h26m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Therefore, I'm here to commission a humble portrait of myself. You may not know him, but there was a folk hero in my town growing up. His name was Fabio. He would frequently pose with windblown hair and an open shirt on a horse. I was thinking something like that, and also I have this figure of Pike. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h27m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h32m15s">Yeah. What little you know of teleportation-based magics, which is not your forte in your bardic experiences, but what you've heard and what you've seen, while you've traveled with Tiberius, and you've come across other individuals that used the arcane spells that caused transport, teleportation circles themselves are a very specific ritual. It's a spell that comes from within the arcane caster's capabilities. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h32m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h32m15s">If you yourself do not have that, you're not going to be able to utilize it at a drop of a hat. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h32m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h32m15s">After asking around, you find there once was a teleportation destination circle in Castle Whitestone that was part of the network of Tal'Dorei, in Emon, but has since been destroyed and sundered and has been for quite some time. You imagine probably when the Briarwoods came, it was deemed a dangerous little loose thread. So, over the period of the next week or so, best you can ascertain is that type of transportation here is going to be probably not likely, at least not with the resources you have at your disposal. You may have to travel elsewhere. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h32m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h35m44s">Yeah. Most of anything of worth, of an arcane nature was confiscated and utilized or essentially melted down for its residuum components as part of the creation of the ziggurat, in preparation for their ritual. So, other than the items you were given when you first arrived here, you're hard-pressed to find anything in this town of that type.

<dt><a href="#l0h36m20s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h36m20s">Well, Keyleth is very confused as to why everyone seems to be avoiding each other. It's odd. Everyone's so standoffish. Anyway, Keyleth is going to go help the farmers and try and maybe help revitalize some of the land and help with planting crops, and helping out there. She also wants to make sure all the local kids are taken care of. Any kids that lost their parents in the rebellion. Lead the charge of making sure the kids are taken care of. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h36m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h36m58s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h36m58s">Okay. Going around, there were a number of casualties in the town as part of the rebellion. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h36m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h36m58s">It unfortunately happens in warfare, regardless of how noble a cause it may be. There are a few families that were left fatherless or motherless, as there was quite a share of the sexes raising up for this battle. So the children that-- no one that you know of lost both parents, for the most part. There was the intent that if there were a parental unit, that at least one had to stay in case of such an occurrence to raise the children. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h36m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h36m58s">But you go out and meet with some of the families and make sure they're taken care of. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h36m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h36m58s">Some of the homes that were destroyed as part of the rebellion, you and Grog both worked together to help make sure the process of rebuilding goes well. You do also help the farmers begin to right their crops and revitalize the land, which had been drained by the necromantic essence of the Briarwoods' presence, and whatever the ziggurat was pulling from the land itself beneath seems to have released its hold on the immediate vicinity. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h36m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h36m58s">So, through your aid specifically, being a druid of your nature, you prepare this for probably one of the finest harvests that Whitestone has had in quite a long time. Even though it is deep winter, they're already seeing early spring growth through your aid. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h36m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h38m48s">Okay, I'm going to spend most of my time organizing the affairs of the castle and the local government and making sure that there's institutions in place, getting rid of anybody who might still have sympathies towards the Briarwoods. Helping re-establish the Zenith and the Ladies' Chamber. Spending some time with my sister. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h38m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h39m16s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h39m16s">On that note, before you continue, there is no current institution in place. Anyone of any political power outside of Archibald, you, and Cassandra, has been slaughtered long past. So in these discussions, you talk with Keeper Yennen, you talk to Cassandra, and there is an air of understanding that right now, there is this period of peace, this period of calm, but there has to eventually be an establishment put into place: some sort of political head to oversee the rebuilding of the city and the continued growth and survival of this town proper. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h39m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h39m16s">Cassandra confides in you multiple times that she is nervous, that she, especially given recent circumstances, her recovery of her Stockholm syndrome with the Briarwoods, is not confident that she would be able to lead on her own. There is a moment where she apologizes extensively to Archibald. Archibald, who did survive, and was her direct contact in the castle, takes a few days before he will even face Cassandra when he is told that she essentially had been leading him astray and spearheading the death of the previous rebellion. You also discover the reason the various new nobles that were prepared for your ambushes were because Cassandra had gotten information about that from Archibald and then fed it to the Briarwoods. But you do sense a very, very deep-seated regret and an urge to make amends for that from her. And because of that circumstance, she doesn't feel like the people of Whitestone, who would have this information, which you haven't told anyone. There is no large-scale announcement. The only people that know about Cassandra's current situation with the Briarwoods are you guys, Keeper Yennen, and Archibald. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h39m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h54m3s">You get word back. Nothing from Allura Vysoren yet. Eskil does respond, saying he is currently finishing up some personal business, but will make his way towards Whitestone within a couple weeks, with some of his compatriots who may also be of aid. Information has been gotten across, but it won't be until probably after this festival for them to begin their investigation. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h54m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h54m3s">However, in the meantime, Keeper Yennen and a few of the smaller local arcanists do make a couple trips down to inspect the ziggurat themselves. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h54m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h54m3s">When they return, Yennen is at a loss. Most of them don't quite understand the nature of the magic there. It seems to be immobile. It seems to be completely either negating, consuming, or preventing any sort of magical force within a specific radius of it. A lot of their normal arcane methods of inspecting or divine methods of inspecting this site are not functional. This is more like bring old tomes and research historical records of things that may be similar to this. So when you bring up that you had reached out to Eskil Ryndarien with the information you had, you gather that will probably be a much more fruitful endeavor. As of right now, no one has any clue what this is. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h54m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h55m35s">Some of the information you acquired from Scanlan's memory and a little bit of research into Vecna. Very little information really exists, but as the keeper of secrets, you get the sense that most anything of importance in dealing with this ritual has been destroyed as part of its preparation because secrets are meant to be kept and hoarded. So not much luck in that regard, unfortunately. However, as the second week draws to a close, the Winter's Crest day comes forward. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h55m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h55m35s">As the morning crests into the proper Winter's Crest festival, you all awaken in Castle Whitestone to an unusually cold morning. As you look out, there is a fresh dusting of white snow that has gently caressed the entirety of this valley and the entire city itself. You all get yourselves ready, gather your belongings and preparing for the festival you've been helping get ready this entire week, you walk down towards Whitestone itself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h55m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h55m35s">As you get to the outskirts of the city, you can already hear in the distance music beginning to play. Blue and white ribbons are hung up all throughout the town, on the outside of buildings, outside of taverns, outside of even the remaining wreckage that is only partially built. It seems that overnight, people just went through the town and decorated whatever needed to be decorated to wipe clean the memory of the recent trials and difficulty that everyone's undergone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h55m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h55m35s">You begin to make your way towards the center of the town, to the town square where the Sun Tree is, and as you approach, you now see the source of the music, as a number of individuals in the town have brought out their instruments. They're playing, some more discordant than others, but overall, a sense of joy as people for the first time in a long time are truly embracing this positive atmosphere. You see children laughing and running through the streets. You can smell fresh-cooked pies and various bakery items just filling the air around you. Looking over, as you approach the Sun Tree, you can see where once bodies hung from its boughs, there now are strings of blue and white ribbons that are intertwined with each other, braided and set across from branch to branch. You can see fine little glass structures that have been hand blown and left to drape from them to be part of the festivities. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h55m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h55m35s">As you begin to make your way up there, immediately people begin to notice your presence, and you can see people in the streets begin to gather up and begin cheering. You hear voices mutter out, "Vox Machina!" People start reaching out and shaking your hands. "Thank you so much, "thank you." You're taken aback by the attention. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h55m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h55m35s">It's reminding you a little bit of the awkwardness you had with the last Winter's Crest in Emon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=0h55m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h14m13s">Two more events go by, two more gentlemen have a showdown-- actually no, it's a woman and a man. The woman is a pretty tough-looking warrior, probably one of the guards of Castle Whitestone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h14m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h14m13s">She's still in partial armor, has been guarding the event, has taken her helmet off to be part of this event, taking a moment to relax. She goes up against another merchant of the town and just destroys him. The next bout is a man who, the way he's dressed, appears to be a blacksmith. He still has his leather gauntlets on, he takes them off at the table, takes off his leather apron and sets it to the side. Gets down and ready and looks around for his opponent and the two guards bring up the chained Vedmeyer, who then sits down at the table, the chains hitting against the sides of the wooden table top and coasting to the ground as they adjust. He puts his arm on the table with a thud, and has to bend over to even reach the other guy's grasp. You can see the look on his face immediately pale as he realizes who he's up against. It's two rounds and maybe 20 seconds tops before Vedmeyer slams him so hard you can part of the tabletop splinters inward and the guy brings his hand back with bleeding knuckles. He reaches over, puts his hand out expectantly. The barmaid hands him a tankard full of ale. He downs it in one gulp, slams it on on the table and stands back up again. He glances over at you and steps back into the crowd. The second round of the events go in. You are paired up with the gentleman who defeated Scanlan. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h14m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h36m21s">The grandest of adventures often stem from humble beginnings. The story of Vox Machina is one such a tale. They begin as a ragtag group of mercenaries in the swamp town of Stillben, eking out a living, when a job board posting brings them to Fendril Vas, the wealthy head of a small merchant empire. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h36m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h36m21s">Hired to investigate new competition in town called The Myriad, the path eventually leads them into a chamber housing a planar rift, pulling the group into the plane of the stillborn god Crysa-Thul. It is revealed that the contract was a ruse to feed the party to the undead, fetal deity. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h36m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h36m21s">Upon destroying the abomination, the party returns to repay Fendril's deceit with a blade to the throat. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h36m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h37m12s">Weeks pass, and Grog the barbarian hasn't been seen since suddenly leaving for the city of Westruun. Heading there in search of him, the party meets his childhood friend, and their new companion: the gnome cleric, Pike. Grog apparently hasn't been acting normally, and had marched off on his own through the Bramblewood towards the ominous mountain, Gatshadow. The party followed, dispensing with a troop of roadside thieves along the way, and wound their way toward the mountain. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h37m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h37m12s">Deep within, they encountered an abandoned subterranean city and eventually a crypt housing a mind-controlled Grog, the reanimated corpse of his father Strongjaw, and a dying mage attempting a ritual to Lichdom. Our heroes slayed the mage, but not before he could complete the ritual and embed his phylactery into Grog's chest. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h37m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h37m12s">Returning to town in search of aid, they find there are few of enough knowledge or power to ascertain the nature of Grog's wound. Also, rumors of missing children begin to reach the party's ears. While contemplating all this at a local inn, the party is approached by a mysterious elf named Drez Vina who wishes to pay handsomely for the party to infiltrate an archmage's tower, and retrieve a particular brass box within. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h37m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h37m12s">Pushing forward in the hopes of speaking with this archmage, the party accepts, and passes through arcane trap after trap to reach the top of the tower, deciding not to steal from the archmage but instead parley with him for his aid. The tower's keeper, Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien, agrees to help and sends the party to collect two items he requires for the ritual: the skull of a nightmare and the heart of a nymph. The caveat: their defeated foe is indeed a lich now, and in merely two weeks, he will be reborn within Grog! They travel north to the Umbra Hills, wrestle with a small cult to slay their infernal messenger and his nightmare steed, and find a fresh companion in Percy, newly freed from imprisonment. From there, the party rushes south to the Frostweald, a forest shrouded in eternal winter. Battling past basilisks, the party finds a single, unfrozen pool where they coax a nymph from her dimensional sanctuary. Talking their way out of battle, Grog enters the sanctuary with the nymph, and returns holding a jewel gifted by the beautiful creature: the "heart" of the nymph. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h37m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h39m47s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h39m47s">Traveling back to the archmage, the ritual is completed and the phylactery destroyed in time, but not without some lingering necromancy branded within Grog. They are suddenly approached by the mysterious elf again, saying his master is unhappy with the broken contract, and he demands that either the debt be paid, or the party complete a more difficult contract in its place. The party accepts, and heads into the Shade Barrow, an ancient druid burial chamber that was purchased and renovated by an eccentric lord who made it his own tomb. Fighting the denizens of the barrow, they locate the tomb and the iron golem guarding it. Successfully defeating the golem, they tear the Arcane Cortex from its chest and return it to Drez to square their debt. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h39m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m47s">After a bit of R and R, a clean-shaven dwarf named Grimthorne propositions the group to enter a nearby, underground fighting ring, even offering to represent them. The party agrees and, not surprisingly, manages to pull off a victory. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h39m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m47s">With the holiday of Winter's Crest arriving, the town bustles with preparation for a festival, during which a strange blue crystal is delivered in the name of Archmage Eskil. This crystal suddenly detonates, freezing the entire populace of Westruun in ice-- though the party is protected by a sudden ally in the streets. In a last-ditch arcane effort, a mystic merchant named Noja manages to shield the group from harm. And where the crystal previously rested now stood a pale, nude woman of white hair and frail physique. She opens a portal and leaps through, the party giving chase into what seems like an icy, frozen world, chaotic and elemental in nature. They catch up to the woman, who then reveals her true self: a great white dragon. Weakened by her premature "rebirth", the party manages to defeat her, and upon returning to Westruun, discover its people released from their icy prison. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h39m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m47s">With the archmage Eskil Ryndarien now on trial for the attack on Westruun, the party intercedes and proves his innocence. In thanks, Eskil uses his talents to investigate the source of the blue crystal, revealing the powerful society of thieves, known as the Clasp, responsible for its delivery. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h39m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m47s">Vax, having previously been a member of the Clasp, knows the main headquarters lies within the capital city of Emon, and Vox Machina sets out for the west. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h39m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h42m32s">Upon arriving in the sprawling metropolis of Emon, the party continues to hear of children disappearing, and reports of a black-haired, golden-eyed boy befriending them before they vanish. While investigating, they do a few odd jobs, one of which unexpectedly leads them to the home of Syldor, Vex and Vax's father, and his new wife and child. Awkwardness aside, Syldor is here as ambassador to Syngorn, the elven city of their origin, to seek aid from the Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h42m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h42m32s">However, the political climate of Emon is tense with a recent, failed attempt on the royal family's life making Uriel unreachable at the moment. Syldor's connection within the Council has now gone missing, and his mission stands at a complete standstill. He hires the party to look in on this missing ally, Sir Gregory Fince, and get his ear back to Syngornian business. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h42m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h42m32s">Vox Machina finds Sir Gregory's home dark and still, pushing them to infiltrate and investigate. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h42m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h42m32s">Within, they discover a dark presence in the home, leading them into a battle with demons in the basement. The battle won, Sir Gregory's tortured corpse is found, as are his notes about the attempted assassination on Uriel and his family. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h42m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h42m32s">It seems that since the attempt, the royal family has grown strange and withdrawn, keeping Uriel from the council most hours, and his wife now demanding she attend all meetings, whispering in the Sovereign's ear and scoffing at the others who defy their decree. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h42m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h42m32s">A General Krieg thwarted the attempt, and is mentioned often. The party decides to inquire with him. On their way out of the basement, half of the party falls into a trap, tumbling into a cistern and are flushed deep below into a subterranean river system. The trapped party members-- Vex, Keyleth, Grog, Tiberius, and Percy-- come to rest on a small island in the vast Crystalfen Lake, home to a terrible aboleth! Barely escaping, they eventually discover the base remnants of an ancient town, long toppled, and a small hut that contains a clever hag named Trysta. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h42m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h42m32s">Tiberius finds one of his prized artifacts and makes a dangerous deal to acquire it. The party barters for information on how to escape, which Trysta will give... in exchange for their aid in slaying a newly nested denizen that threatens her work. The party agrees, climbing to the very top of the Crystalfen Cavern to do battle with an umber-hulk. The fight goes south when Grog is tossed from the cavern ceiling, nearly dying upon impact with the island, but victory is eventually theirs. Returning, Trysta shows them a hidden staircase that exits into the Graveyard District of Emon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h42m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h45m36s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h45m36s">The other members-- Vax, Pike, and Scanlan-- set out to find where the cistern could have drained to. Scanlan leaves to seek out a map of the sewers, while Vax and Pike notice they are being followed through the town. Leading the pursuers into an alley, the shadowed figures attack, eventually knocking them both out. Vax and Pike awaken within the Clasp's headquarters, meeting with one of their leaders, or Spirelings, named Modeth. The Clasp had Sir Gregory's home under surveillance, as bad political stuff can be difficult for the way the Clasp does business, and when our heroes were spotted leaving, they had to be interrogated. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h45m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h45m36s">Vax reveals his membership to the Clasp sect in Westruun, and Modeth calls for a test of their skills and intent. Pike and Vax are then forced to do battle with a chained chimera in the Clasp's arena. Their might rings true, and the beast falls beneath their weapons, but Modeth is not convinced. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h45m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h45m36s">While the two are held overnight, they manage to escape from the Clasp's lair, exiting into the night and managing to locate the rest of the party in the Graveyard district. Knowing their next step is to speak with General Krieg, Vax forges a letter of summons using Sir Gregory's handwriting, and the party is allowed entry into the carefully guarded Cloudtop District, the innermost area of the city and home to the Citrine Garrison, as well as Emon's Palace. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h45m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h45m36s">Approaching the garrison, they have an audience with General Krieg, who seems nice and keenly interested upon learning of the Clasp's involvement. He also mentions the difficulty in talking with Uriel since the attack, and is sad about the death of Sir Gregory, but warns to leave the investigation to the officials. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h45m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h45m36s">Vox Machina then heads to the palace to try their hand at speaking with Uriel, but entry is barred. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h45m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h45m36s">They find another is being prevented from entering, a golden-haired woman in fancy blue robes who angrily stomps away from the palace doors. They engage her in conversation, and she reveals herself to be Allura Vysoren, a powerful arcanist and member of the Tal'Dorei Council. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h45m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h45m36s">They discuss the state of things within the palace, how Uriel is a good and trusted man, but his actions (and those of the Empress Salda) are recently suspect. After seven days of being kept from the council chambers, she's about to give up and leave. The party tells her of their findings, and Allura leads them to her tower within the district to further discuss the matter in private. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h45m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h48m39s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h48m39s">Within, Allura and the party make an alliance, and Keyleth aids her in performing a scrying ritual on the palace. The vision reveals that the family of Uriel-- his wife, two daughters, and son-- are all under the influence of some demonic force, and have addled the mind of their father, using him as a mouthpiece for their plot. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h48m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h48m39s">The party decides to pay a visit to the Clasp, using Vax and Pike's knowledge of an entrance, and end up in a confrontation with Spireling Modeth within his chambers. The battle ends with Modeth's head on the floor and four strange, glowing crystals he had been keeping now stolen by the party. They attempt to leave, but are met by a host of Clasp members and another, dangerous-looking Spireling. Through Scanlan's deft lies and coercion, the party is allowed to leave unharmed before their deeds are discovered. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h48m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h48m39s">They return to Allura's tower only to find the front door ajar and the interior tossed by some previous scuffle. As they reach the top of the tower, they investigate, finding signs of a struggle with a demonic entity, and Allura's escape seemingly successful. Unfortunately, a magical defense of the tower is triggered, and it begins to cave and crumble around them. Through some ingenuity-- and the discovery of a magic carpet-- the party manages to escape being crushed within, Allura's ivory monolith now compacted into a single, magical pearl. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h48m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h48m39s">Our heroes then locate and enter the home of General Krieg, finding a brainwashed servant and a hidden passage that leads to a teleportation circle. Using the device, they are transported to a distant cavern, high in a range of frost-covered mountains, and an incredible hoard of gold, jewels, and fine trinkets. Across the room are four obsidian orbs placed within the rock. As one is touched, a giant eye appears from within the black crystal and a voice erupts, calling for a Brimscythe, and noticing the unfamiliar folk, mentions, "Intruders... I know your face now. He "is a fool, and so are you, insect." The orbs all crack simultaneously, becoming inert. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h48m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h48m39s">Grog dives right in, rage-looting the gold, but the arrival of the party seems to call the attention of General Krieg, who appears at the teleportation circle. He angrily denounces the party and reveals his true form, that of a frightening blue dragon! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h48m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h51m21s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h51m21s">The battle is difficult, with many an ally nearly devoured, but eventually Vax strikes a mortal blow. Krieg, or Brimscythe, defiantly smashes against the support pillars of the cavern in his death throes, causing the chamber to collapse, the party barely escaping via the teleportation circle. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h51m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h51m21s">Leaving Krieg's home, Allura finds the party and warns that the evil that feeds on the throne is growing more bold. She herself was attacked shortly after the scrying was complete, and barely escaped. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h51m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h51m21s">As dark clouds fill the sky above Emon, the party decides the time to strike has come. Allura aids the party in infiltrating the palace, and they storm the throne room. Uriel sits upon his throne, surrounded by his creepily mannered, possessed family. Vox Machina attacks, managing to banish the shadows from within their bodies, but the throne itself cracks in half as the dais below glows a deep red, summoning the entity behind the entire scheme: a devil prince called Juurezel, who tells the party of a great war between devils and demons spilling over into this plane, threatening all creation. He justifies his actions, and notes all the demonic forces throughout the city, and tells them of the horrible devastation that will ensue if the party stops him. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h51m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h51m21s">They read him as honest, and Juurezel asks for their aid in destroying the demonic threat, offering a single Wish should they make a pact. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h51m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h51m21s">The party deliberates and agrees to the contract. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h51m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h51m21s">Thinking over what they had just agreed to, the party returns to the throne room, asking for their Wish to be provided to aid them in their demon hunting. Upon its casting, the party wishes to cancel their contract with the creature, and attack! The devil prince angrily reveals his true form, a hideous treachery demon, a glabrezu. A long, deadly, and epic confrontation ensues, one that suddenly claims the life of the gnomish cleric, Pike. Her death fresh in their minds, Vox Machina deals the killing blow, sending the demon to its unmaking. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h51m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h51m21s">They gather up the cold body of their fallen friend and rush her to a nearby temple of Sarenrae, where a resurrection ritual is attempted... and succeeds. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h51m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h53m43s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">The clouds disperse, the immediate danger over, but the royal family lies on the throne room floor, catatonic. Upon inspection, their souls are missing and their bodies failing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">The party recalls the four glowing orbs they recovered from the Clasp headquarters behind Modeth, now identified as soul jars, and through a rigorous and tense evening, all souls are successfully restored to the family. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">A few days pass, and Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei calls the party for audience. He thanks them all for their bravery, heroism, and for saving him, his family, and quite possibly all of Emon. As thanks, he offers them a place on the Tal'Dorei Council and informs them of his intent to throw another Winter's Crest festival to make up for the ones ruined in Westruun, and here via assassination attempt, where they will be celebrated as heroes! He has also commissioned the construction of a keep for them on the outskirts of Emon as a sign of his very deep gratitude. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">A week later, the festival begins! The populace is out in full force to meet and celebrate Vox Machina, but during the festivities, the party notices Uriel's son Gren speaking to another child-- one with black hair and golden eyes. They immediately spring to apprehend the child, but he escapes with Uriel's son. They give chase, following him into an alley, and through a portal of some kind. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">The party finds themselves atop a large island drifting through the Astral Plane, surrounded by a perilous bramble forest. They fight their way through, eventually coming upon a gothic mansion towards the center of the landmass. Within, the party makes their way to the inner library, where numerous kidnapped children are working all about the place, cleaning nervously. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">The Dread Emperor, as he calls himself, stands from his chair, the child illusion fading into a golden-armored man with long, black hair, four children chained at the neck to his breastplate. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">He attacks the party with fierce magic, mind-controlling all of his child servants to attack as well. With the first blow dealt, they realize that damaging him also hurts the chained children, one boy accidentally falling in battle to Keyleth's magic. Eventually, they succeeded in destroying the Dread Emperor and return to Emon with a host of lost children, happily now found. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">Six months of peace follow as their new keep is constructed, and the party scatters to their separate business until its completion. Upon their return, they assess their new abode with delight, naming it Greyskull Keep. They then send out job inquiries, seeking guards for hire, and servants. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m43s">After an impromptu try-out, they settle upon their new hires. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h53m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h56m44s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h56m44s">That evening, the party receives a visitor in their friend Arcanist Allura Vysoren. She happily sits with the party for dinner, and trades tales of their past months, before asking if she could hire their services for a matter of great personal importance. Allura's longtime friend and ally, Lady Kima of Vord, has gone missing, following a vision quest from her deity, the platinum dragon Bahamut. Her last letter spoke of an evil taking root beneath the dwarven city of Kraghammer, and Allura worries for her safety. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h56m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h56m44s">While Allura is unable to go herself, she can provide the proper paperwork for entry, and would pay handsomely if they could find, aid, and return with Kima. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h56m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h56m44s">Vox Machina agrees to the new contract and sets out for the city of Kraghammer the very next day. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=1h56m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

That being the case, when the rest of them decide they want to join us, those who are going towards the pie eating contest. You start pushing through the crowd, making your way towards the two long tables that are set up.

We gather today to celebrate for the first "time in many years, our own Winter's Crest festival." There's some clapping. "It is on this "day that we remember, centuries ago, when Erevan, the Ice King, Keeper of the Far Realm of Ice and 'the Elemental Planes, attempted to tear his way into Tal'Dorei, was kept at bay and sent back "packing from whence he came." There are some cheers from the crowd. "In this, we also are "reminded of family, reminded of friendship, and the bonds that we as a people keep ourselves and "our families safe, that we rise up to the occasion to show true heroism. To stand by our beliefs and "not let the darkness swallow our hope. And by that, we are able to bring to you, this day, the "surviving members of the de Rolo family: Cassandra and Percival." You hear some whistles from the crowd and some cheers well up again. Some shouts, "de Rolo!" some yells from the crowd. Keeper Yennen puts his arms out.

<dd id="l2h44m31s">I am going to get a tattoo to commemorate my year at Geek and Sundry here. And I would like that to be of you guys's design. So I'm going to challenge you guys on the internet to tag me and a week from today, I will Periscope me getting a tattoo that someone in the chat room designed. Most likely a Snugglelord; it'd be cool if it was a Snugglelord. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=2h44m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h47m3s">So, the plan is, the mods will be creating a Twitch playlist, so it won't show up as us being online. It will say we're offline, but you can come to our actual Twitch page and there will be marathons of each show individually. Critical Role will be later on. It's not going to be the first one that we marathon and that will be for probably a week and a half until I get into the studio and make actual playlists and you'll get that e-mail that says-- probably not Critical Role, but just an entire streaming marathon-- I don't even know. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=2h47m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h47m3s">I'll figure it out. I've got a week and a half to figure it out, but there will be a playlist coming right up. Next Monday. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=2h47m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
