<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. I think we're recording, because my camera light's not on, but nevertheless, welcome. (laughs) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m11s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m11s">We're totally recording. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h0m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m12s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m12s">I'm pretty sure we are. Anyway guys, welcome, we have a fantastic guest who will be joining us later this evening, but before we get to that we have announcements to go over real fast. First and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by a new sponsor, a fantastic group called Quidd! If you want to talk about that first? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h0m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m29s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m29s">Hi, guys. Vacation Sam here. Quidd is our sponsor tonight, a fantastic new sticker app for your phone. You can check it out at bitly, that's bit.ly/crquidd. I didn't know much about the company, but Quidd sounded vaguely British, so little-known fact about me, I have access to the BBC archives at home, so I did some snooping and sure enough, I found a World War II newsreel transcript that talked about Quidd, so I thought I would do a dramatic reading of it for you right now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h0m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m8s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m8s">Here we go. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m9s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m9s">News from the front! This is Nigel J. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m9s">Creamhutch reporting from BBC London. March 23, 1944 may be a turning point in WWII as PM Churchill announces a new weapon in the fight against those devilish Nazis. They're calling it Quidd, a new app where you can collect stickers, cards and Funko figures on your telephone device. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m9s">Our lads on the frontlines are already using it! We spoke with Lieutenant Neville Bingham of the Royal Navy. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m9s">Right, yeah, Quidd's this free app available on the Apple App Store and Google Play, and it's helping us drive Hitler back to Berlin. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m9s">But it's not just our Tommies. The Reds have discovered Quidd as well! We spoke with tank commander Ivan Bashenko. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m9s">With Quidd, Russian army is strongest in world. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m9s">Morale better now with thousands of stickers to collect that can be used like emojis in messages to your friends. Stalingrad will not fall with these cute stickers! Why, they're even using Quidd across the pond! We spoke with American sergeant John Smith, an American Doughboy. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m9s">I'm John, an American. We American GIs love to collect stickers from brands like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, Breaking Bad, Star Trek, and newly announced Game of Thrones. Take that, Emperor Hirohito! Well, there you have it, ladies and gents. Your British Armed Forces and our allies will defeat the Nazis and win the Second Great War if you go to bit.ly/crquidd and check out Quidd. Good night, good luck, and god save the queen, pip pip! (cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h1m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m59s">What's that? Oh that's right, and at GenCon next month we have our live show, we mentioned it last week. Tickets are still on sale for the general admission. We're looking forward to having you guys there, it's Friday evening. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h5m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m11s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m11s">Yeah, it's Friday evening, 7:30. In fact, we got an even bigger theatre this year. The last theatre had 1,500 seats, we're like, oh, we'll never get that many people, and it went (explosion sound). It filled up, so we got a 2,500 seat theatre. It's massive, it's a huge party, if you didn't join us last year, you want to come to this mayhem. It's so much fun. You don't need passes to GenCon, by the way, you don't have to have a badge or anything for that, it's a standalone thing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h6m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m11s">There are definitely tickets still available, it's going to be super fun. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h6m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m39s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m39s">I feel like with that many people we should have beach balls in the audience, and they can do the wave. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h6m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m56s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m56s">Anyway, without further ado, I think that concludes our announcements, and as such, let us dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h6m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m56s">[dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h6m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m37s">Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So where we left off last time. Vox Machina, having finally encountered the Undying King, returned in physical form in the Shadowfell, did battle and fled, quite unprepared for that venture, and gathered some tidbits of information about what Vecna's plans may be. Upon returning and discovering that your disintegrated Vax has returned through some deal he made with his patron the Raven Queen after disintegrating, you decided to go ahead and try and gather more information about this and beseech some of the higher powers within Exandria. Pike talked to Sarenrae and was given the invitation to come visit her in Elysium on the Island of Renewal, and upon gathering your materials and causing a mess in Vasselheim, you got together and went to meet this fantastic Everlight. On her island, you spoke with her. She gathered some information from you, as Vecna seemed to be blocking at least the influence and vision from a lot of the deities, and then gave her blessing unto Pike, transferring you over to one of the other gods that lives among the Blessed Fields of Elysium: Pelor, the Dawnfather. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h8m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m37s">You then walked through the orchards that led to the Fortress of the Sun where he resides, spoke with some of the guardians there, and were led into the center of the citadel, where you met, in the central throne room under the Zenith Tower, Pelor himself. Upon exchanging information, you spoke of your need to gather the favor of certain gods in the battles to come, and were given a challenge. To step up to plate: Vex'ahlia. You accepted the challenge and racing to the top of the tower, the zenith, before the fires could be extinguished in the brazier that awaited you, you threw yourself into the fire, and upon the party speaking on what it was that made Vex'ahlia such an important member of not just your team, but your family, and gave you strength, she was imbued with a blessing of the Dawnfather himself. After which, we left off as you exited the front of the Fortress of the Sun, stepped into the central glade that marks the center of the seemingly endless orchards that surround this region, and Vox Machina, what would you like to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h8m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h35m25s">It's a comfortable evening's rest. You all find yourselves through the evening. As you sleep, and having this being the first time many of you have slept in Terrah, it takes you a while. There is just a general low hum or vibration to the ground that you sleep on. You get the sense it's probably proximity to the Rift, but there is this slow, perpetual (rumbling). It's like a weird, low rumble. Like a heavy bass sound that never seems to dissipate that you hadn't noticed until you were trying to quietly sleep. But it's not off-putting and within ten or 15 minutes, it actually almost helps to lull you to rest. You all come to in the morning, gather your supplies, and are preparing for the next leg of your journey. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h35m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h51m26s">Okay, that'll do it. Your speed is tremendous when in this form, so what would have been an extended trek on foot over a series of days, it takes you mere hours to eventually get to a point where you crest one heavy peak. On the opposite side, you can see down the cliffside, the edge reaches a slight precipice, and there you can see what looks to be for a mile or so a cluster of dozens and dozens of pools of water of different sizes, all jammed together in a geothermic cluster, where you can see bright greens that move to a deep orange-maroon at the edges from the various mineral deposits that have collected over hundreds and hundreds of years. You can see large columns of smoke and steam of different chemical colors rising out of various large pools, and at a glance down, you can see a number of shapes: a number of hulking, humanoid shapes; somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 or so scattered at different pools, moving in small clusters or gangs. Some of them are jumping in, cannonballing and swimming through the actual pools. Some of them are lounging around and lying. Some of them appear to be returning, dragging things from the nearby forest on the eastern side of the bank. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h51m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h52m53s">Essentially, for a few hundred years, you get the sense that the Pools of Wittebak have been a hill giant water park. You can see these large mounds of mud and scrap wood and things that have been built into these large hill giant domiciles onto the side of the mountain not far from the pools. It's become a definite hill giant wandering zone. So do you guys continue over the pools, down towards the nearby forest ridge? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h52m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h53m22s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h53m23s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h53m23s">All righty. You come to the forest ridge, and you can see it's not thick forest. The ravine comes down off the precipice where the pools are. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h53m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h53m23s">You get a few hundred-- I'd say, actually more than that. A thousand or more feet away from that precipice before plants even begin to grow. It looks like whatever toxic chemicals have burbled up in some of these pools have made a lot of the ground there unable to give any forest life or sustain any large trees. As soon as the forest begins, it's a dense little pocket, maybe a mile and a half, two miles across. That's what you've got. What do you guys want to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h53m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h55m20s">So with Pike following suit, you guys all swoop down through the boughs of the trees and into the center of the forest itself. Within there, it's not a super thick canopy; it's not as heavy as the Feywild or some of the recent forests that cluster around Vasselheim. There are breaks in the canopy where you can see the sunbeams come through from the morning sun that's rising up higher and higher in the sky as you've traveled. The mist has burned away in this area, so it's a nice, warm forest. Glancing about, there is a lot of life in here. You can see signs of squirrels. You rush by what was a family of wolverine-like creatures that are rustling by. As soon as the wind scoots in and your mist forms come rocketing past, they all scatter and run off into the shadows. There's a lot of forest ground here to cover. For you to really super track with advantage, you'd have to go into human form. I'd give you a regular roll if you want to try and track in your mist form. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h55m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h56m42s">27. Begin coasting through tree after tree through small, tiny bits of clearing that immediately come into large clusters of trunks and knotted branches that all merge and cluster at different intersections. After about 20 or so minutes of this, trying to do a large spiral around the forest inward, out of the corner of your eye, Vex'ahlia, you glance over and see a quick glimpse of something that appears to be more structured. You look back and rush over and there you see amongst the trees what appears to be a humble-looking two-story home. You see a small balcony built on the second floor that goes over one of the larger rooms in the bottom floor. It's not huge, by any means, and is hidden by a lot of the local brush and trees there. Can't get a lot more detail at this distance, though. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=0h56m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

(fast travel noise) As you pass through one of its many portholes. Then, adrift. By now you've-- the times you've passed through the gate, you've passed through it a handful of times since now. Adrift. Still holding hands, but the circle's beginning to turn into an oval. You can all glance around and see each other. Did you miss your destination? Did you overshoot? What's next? (whoosh) Another white flash. And suddenly you're at a destination. You glance around and you're standing within a small chamber.

<dd id="l3h40m2s">As you guys walk forward towards the singular hallway, you go through the domed arch, and the hallway extends on. Featureless, smooth grey marble. Like a solid punch that seemed to have carved out whatever this material was. It extends for 100 feet. 150 feet. And even though there's very very faint light, and many of you can see through darkvision, there is a darkness about 60 feet from you that seems to consume what you can see. You can only see so far beyond that radius, and you're not quite sure where that oppressive shadow is coming from. The air is chilled, but not uncomfortably so. You can hear the distant sound of pinched winds whining through small spaces. A familiar sound from the many times you've spent underground, through caverns that had some openings that allowed air to streak through to the surface. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=3h40m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h40m2s">A few steps more and suddenly the hallway opens into a second chamber. Into a library, if you could even call it that. Bookshelves that stretch upward for seemingly hundreds of feet, before flickering lights fell from your vision. You do not see where they stop. These columns of just tomes and cases and scrolls and parchments stacking as in tablets and any form of recorded information seem to just be infinite in front of you, to two sides of this road and upward. They seem to stretch in almost every direction, the walls to the side of you. You see columns ahead of you, and they tend to wind and curl like a labyrinth made of bookcases, to no end. It's very Escher-esque in how the further up you look, they tend to curve and shift and bend around each other. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=3h40m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h40m2s">Your eyes, now attuned to the realms beyond mortality, you catch glimpses of shifting wind gathering books and turning pages. Spirits of the library, though sparse as they may be from this entry point, organizing. Reading and learning from whatever words are within. You begin to almost get vertigo, trying to contemplate the strange and overwhelming construction of such a wondrous place. An endless sea of stories. Spectral custodians keeping the tales of each other and the history of Exandria past, present, and binding the pages to tell what will eventually be the present, currently the future. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=3h40m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h58m18s">An echoing voice billows out from the right side of your troupe. A creaky, warm, matronly voice that surrounds and almost welcomes you with the intonation of a grandmother. It says, "Nothing is "forever, Percival." You glance off to the right, and you can see there's a break in the bookcase. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=3h58m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h58m18s">To your right, you see the shelves have stopped ahead in this direction to reveal a circular common area within the library, where the ground domes downward into an 80-foot-wide concave pit of cushions and tables, all standing at odd angles alongside this pit, but never sliding. Gravity seems to shift depending on where the dome stands. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=3h58m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h58m18s">These tables hold teacups and writing implements and various other décor, and things that involve binding and writing. None of them slipping, all of them affixed to the table as the dome slowly comes to a central rest. Long, spiraling streams of silver, blue, and gray silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight, and they come down like drifting silks that push past as you enter the area. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=3h58m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h58m18s">Sitting 40 feet from you in the center of the dome, no larger than a normal person, is an older woman with long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is somewhat weathered and wrinkled around her almond eyes, but the warmth of her smile, and her vibrant purple irises put you at ease immediately. Her blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that snake through the pillows like roots. She smiles as you turn and see her. "I felt that you would find me." And that's where we'll end tonight's session. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=uwNxxXtGxgM&t=3h58m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
