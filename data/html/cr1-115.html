<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Glad you could join us for what is essentially the final and epilogue episode of our five-year campaign. We're excited you guys could come join us. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m16s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m16s">Not the final episode of the show! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h0m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m17s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m17s">We will return. We're looking probably at the start of the new year with a new campaign, new characters. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h0m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m24s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m24s">But we'll have one-shots and stuff in between. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h0m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m26s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m26s">Yeah, we'll have fun stuff to break it up and give us some time to let off some steam in the meantime. But before we get into tonight's game, let's get through some quick announcements. First off, we wanted to give a shout out. If you guys haven't seen it yet, Shadow of War just came out, the sequel to Shadow of Mordor. A bunch of us have worked on it and if you haven't seen, we had the opportunity to do a cool thing with WB Games and the folks at Monolith. We did a Shadow of War one-shot that was uploaded as a two-parter. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h0m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m50s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h1m2s">It was a lot of fun. We had Sam, Laura, Travis, and the illustrious Darin De Paul as our four orcs and/or olog-hai, charging their way through Mordor in hopes of victory spoils and all that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h1m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h2m0s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m0s">I wish I still had the video of you that you sent me after you first started, yeah. When he first started playing Gollum, he sent me this video of him running around his living room, jumping up on his couch, then running over and jumping up your entertainment system or something. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h2m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h13m43s">All right. Last we left off, Vox Machina, through their trials and tribulations, had eventually come to realize the machinations of Vecna, who ascended into godhood, transported his city from the Shadowfell of Thar Amphala to the top, right above a long-dead earth primordial titan, rising it and making its way toward Vasselheim, the Dawn City, the beginning of creation. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h13m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m43s">You battled your way through its innards, up within the arcane dome that protected it, managed to defeat one half of the long-frustrating Briarwood coupling, fought your way to the top of the tower Entropis, did battle with Vecna, the Ascended. Through careful planning and sacrifices, you managed to apply the trammels, complete the sealing ritual, and send Vecna screaming across the Divine Gate, to be sealed to wherever his divine demi-plane resides on the other side. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h13m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m43s">As you all fell down upon the ruined, floating platforms of the tower Entropis, you glanced over as your recent ally, Arkhan the Cruel, proceeded to sever his own hand, attach the Hand of Vecna, and catching you off guard, transport himself beyond your current reach. This beat of intensity releasing slowly, the adrenaline still wearing its way through your veins, you sit in silence, looking about, amazed that you all still stand after such a confrontation. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h13m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m43s">It's at that moment you hear this distant explosion. Glancing off the side of the platform you're on, you can still see, while the large titan, one of four arms raised, attempting to come and destroy all of you with one large blow, frozen in place, there still remains the dregs of Vecna's army down below throughout the city of Vasselheim, where battles are still raging in the streets. You can still see wyvern-riders and eagle-riders in the sky, though it appears that the gloomstalkers that once paraded across the skies over the city have been destroyed or scattered at the loss of the ascended god that summoned them. You also still are aware of the body of your sister, residing on the platforms below. It's at this point that you notice that the green tendrils of energy that hold the Tower of Entropis together begin to flicker and subside. The platforms that were slowly drifting, listing, suddenly begin to shift. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h13m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

So the last thing you hear from Percival is, "Could you throw--" as he darts off to the side. The platform is beginning to give as the flickering green energy begins to fade. You guys both dart beneath where you can see upon the rubble, where the top staircase had broken apart from the original sundering of the top of the tower. There you see, still lying there, lifeless, the body of Velora. You rush in there just as the platform's collapsing. I need you both to make acrobatics checks on this to see how quickly you can maneuver in and out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=0h17m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h38m38s">Okay. As you complete the ritual, all the sigils in place lighting up, it's unique because you're used to the ritual completed by an acolyte of Sarenrae, in which everything has a glow of warmth to it. This ritual was completed by an acolyte of an entity named Vesh, and as each sigil flares, you watch as they darken into the deepest shadow. It's a yin-yang dichotomy as the spell begins to take effect, until eventually the whole circle becomes pitch black, like the deepest of lightless midnight. At that moment, you watch as Velora's form itself is also cast into shadow and disappears from view. And for a moment, you fear she is gone, before the shadow begins to peel away like a cocoon, and as it tears and rolls back, the subtle sound of sand shifting and paper crackling, you watch as her chest begins to move once more, breathing, her eyes still closed, but life breathes into her lungs once more.

In the chaos, you hadn't noticed that when Vecna had been dispelled, the force cage that had maintained and locked in J'mon Sa Ord had vanished. You see them turn around and look towards you in humanoid form. They approach with the long, jet-black hair, the darkened skin, the beautiful coal-like ember eyes. Tall, almost as tall as Grog, though lithe in form and simply clothed. J'mon approaches. "Well, I'm certainly "impressed.

<dd id="l1h11m50s">All right. So do you all climb up onto J'mon's back? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h11m56s">All right. J'mon, in Devo'ssa form, then begins to run at a fast speed towards the edge of the city. Eventually, the wings begin to flap, and with one giant thrust of wind, ascends. And once again, you feel the wind rocket through your hair, as was your entry towards the titan. You begin to crest over the edge of Thar Amphala, over the titan, and down towards the center of Vasselheim, the wind roaring past your face, your cloaks whipping behind you. You have a bird's-eye view of the city that you've essentially saved. And really, did so through a quick jaunt to the Feywild. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m56s">The Braving Grounds still, while in severe disarray and flames still burn, most everything's under control now. Whatever remains of the remnant cultists, warriors, and undead have either been destroyed, captured, or run out of the city. As you pick up 40, 50 feet over the rooftops, you see as hundreds of survivors have haphazardly armed Bastions, as civilians of Vasselheim have picked up whatever arms were available, of soldiers in the streets, children holding the hands of their families, all glance up and point at the majestic brass dragon that coasts not more than maybe 40, 50 feet ahead, signifying once more a symbol of hope and victory. You hear the shouts behind you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m56s">As you begin to make your way around the Heaven's Stair mountain and then up, gliding over the steps leading up towards the platinum sanctuary. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m56s">As you begin to glide up, you can see the steps are littered with broken bone, splatters of blood, broken bodies and silvered armor, and familiar black sludge, connoting the remains of slain gloomstalkers. The immediate ground conflict is over here and has been for some time. The stillness is now occupied with clusters of wounded riders and platinum warriors that now rest atop the apex of the stair and the sanctuary platform itself before you approach the entryway in the pillars. As you ascend, floating up, Devo'ssa lands right at the top of the stair as all the soldiers and medics who are in the process of handling the wounded, gathering the dead, all stop and look at the majestic brass dragon form as they lower themselves to allow each of you to carefully step off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m56s">As you do, you watch as the chatter, the conversation, the quiver of worry, the intensity of the recovery, comes to stillness as each of the soldiers, even those who have seen better days, stand up with a look of acknowledgment, greeting you as you arrive, and all give a respectful bow of the head or kneel to you as you approach and pass by. In the stillness, you begin to walk towards the opening of the sanctuary, the doors open already, and glance over your shoulder to see that J'mon has retaken their human form and is now walking at your side. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m56s">Entering the sanctuary, you can see folks are rushing around a bit, and they notice your arrival, as well, but are also trying to make sure that everything is accounted for, and there's a bit of hustle and bustle. The old Scalebearer Yon, who greeted you first to Vasselheim, approaches quickly. "Oh, goodness me! Hello? You're well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m56s">You've looked better, but so have we. That's fine. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m56s">"I have questions to ask. But perhaps it's best that-- come with me." And darts back towards the central meeting chambers of the Platinum Sanctuary. You can see the circle of pillars that surround the wide marbled floors of the center chamber where all these council meetings have previously taken place. You can see battle has taken place here. While most of the bodies or the wounded or dead have been removed at this point, you can see there are elements of chipped and broken stone and marble. You can see scattered remains and blood stains at points towards the entryway. But most of it appears to have been halted at the entryway. All of the combat has halted within the sanctuary. Glancing past, you can see most of the council you met last is not here. They're probably handling their various portions of the city. But you do see amongst a number of inner guardians of the sanctuary Highbearer Vord, who himself looks like he's seen a bit of a fray, and Allura Vysoren to his side. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h11m56s">Both harried, but alive. As soon as you begin to approach, their conversation comes to a halt. As Allura turns and sees you all, her face brightens and she immediately rushes up, tossing any sort of formalities to the side, and runs up. Before she can give you a hug, she sees the child in your arms. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h11m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

I am ashamed at my misjudgment." He looks around as folks begin to gather. He acknowledges J'mon, who's approached. They've bowed, carefully. "Many heroes rose to challenge "this day. Many we've lost. And many others that remain to remember them. Let us vow to never "forget those who gave everything so that we could still stand here to remember.

The rest of the room who's begun to gather now, you see other soldiers that were waiting outside as you first approached have begun to filter in.

<dd id="l1h26m23s">The sun-glass roof, which currently has been sitting within the shadow of the mountain, the sunlight begins to peak past and glide its way across the marble floor as everyone's cheering and the room now, which once was in shadow of the mountain, is now lit up with sunlight. Now you can see the glittering armor that peeks through the dirt, the grime, the blood, shining and sparkling on each of you, across Pike's beautiful armor, across all the warriors that stand here, across the Scalebearer's design, across your hair. The room is filled with light and though you sense the presence of probably Bahamut, glancing down you can't help but think that this is also the approving glance of Pelor, perhaps a bit of the Everlight. As the cheers begin to fade, the crowd begins to pull away. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h26m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You turn around to look at the rest of your family and as you guys look at his face, in but a flash you can see this dark shape behind him. This looming black cloak, this lithe dress that cascades down into a bell and drags across the ground. And there you see the form of the Raven Queen, porcelain mask, long dark hair behind, as her hands slowly creep over the shoulders of Vax'ildan. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=1h26m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As she finishes casting the spell, you could see some of the nearby wardens of the Platinum Sanctuary go, "Um--" "I know it's arcane, shut up. It's fine." You all take off the steps and begin to glide down over to the city, and there you can already see people are coming out of their homes. Exactly. So eventually, you find your way north to the Quadroads, towards the base of the Heaven Stair Mountain, where the temple resides. The temple looks like it's sustained a little bit of damage. It looks like a portion of the upper floor of the three-tier tower-- Colosseum-esque, but it does taper a bit towards the top. The top part has partially fallen in and it looks like it's seen wear and tear, but it doesn't look like it's been destroyed or anything. As you come up to the temple, you can already see there are refugees of homes that were destroyed from the incursion of the Braving Grounds that are being gathered in and the temple's filled with people. On the outside, you see Gesyra, the older woman who helped you found the temple and build it. As she approaches, she's now one of the Priests of Rebirth and has been working with you for some time and turns and sees your face. You can see her graying hair, which is bunned up very tightly in the back. She has her spectacles and she has the long robes of blue and gold. She sees you. "My "Pike!" She rushes up and gives you a hug. She's much bigger than you, being a human, but her posture puts her almost on your level.

<dd id="l2h51m40s">Yeah. Allura takes a moment and squints her eyes for a second, apparently Sending another message, and then nodding. She leads you guys towards the Quadroads, and finds a pub called The Quarry's End. And it's not too far from Sarenrae's temple, which is why she chose it, and it looks to be like it was near a quarry that was built into the mountain that either dried up or was closed down for some reason, and then a tavern was opened instead as a means of still making money. It's super dive-y, it smells of stained wood and spilled wine. It's musty and perfect. And as you all come in, it's mostly empty, as people are still in the process of trying to figure things out. The few that are in there appear to be wounded soldiers that, as opposed to getting medical help, are in the process of drinking themselves into a numb state. But you find a table, you sit down, one of the barmaids comes up to you, goes: "Drinking away the fray, are you?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=2h51m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h22m34s">As you're out there on your own, contemplating quietly, ruminating on the day, a faint howl finds the air, and stepping from the shadows, you see a large gray wolf: Galdric, the wolf that once belonged to the previous champion of the Raven Queen, Purvan, who was given charge over the forests on the outside. Saunters up to you. He is a large wolf. You are a tiny gnome. He steps up, sits next to you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=3h22m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The night is so cold, you can see your breath in the dark air through the beams of moonlight that make it through the canopy. As the wolf looks down at you, his intense eyes making a full scan of what you are, there's a recognition to his expression. The wolf looks back up. (howls) And gives a long, baleful howl, seemingly in remembrance and acknowledging that one with a familiar path to his has found his way back to the realm of the Raven Queen, as well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=3h22m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h34m14s">Pandemonium is a plane of madness: a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then only at a maximum distance of ten feet. Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment. So yeah, that's a fun time. It's a fun adventure you guys go on to retrieve Grog's soul. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=3h34m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h50m27s">So following off that, the story of Taryon Darrington, which I have something written for here based off what he did. Feel free to embellish or change how you see fit. As the months pass, the Darrington family has adjusted somewhat to a more humble lifestyle, and their work of charity within the city of Deastok and the neighboring lands goes far to clean up the family name from where it once was. While their influence was greatly diminished and they're essentially a political laughingstock, the message of their work still strikes a chord in some of the more philanthropic lords to the north and an alliance is made that protects the Darrington name and interests from the Myriad's ever wiley grasp for the time being. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=3h50m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h50m27s">Doty 3.0 now stands a shining golden color, gifted the materials by a thankful ore baron whom Taryon's Brigade of Adventurers saved from a terrifying doppelgänger's plot. His troupe continues to gain a small bit of notoriety in the southern lands of the Dwendalian Empire, some good, some humorous. His mother, Mariya, ever cheering them on and making their tabards for years before passing away peacefully, proud of her boy. Her passing brings the rest of the family closer together than it's ever been. And the charitable efforts, surprisingly, of Howaardt now encompass the Darrington Brigade as a non-profit adventuring league. During a gambling run in Port Demali to follow, Taryon stumbles upon a now slightly more haggard Lawrence, now working as a tanner. They immediately fell right back where they left off and Lawrence cashed in his life as a leather worker to join the Brigade alongside Taryon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=3h50m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Sometimes it's hard being a prodigy because then you just grow up to be a regular adult. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=4h16m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

He tugs your hand and walks back, leaves you there on the cliff side looking out. As the sunlight slowly blinks away over the horizon, leaving you with the purples and blues of the night sky as the stars begin to glitter up, you can hear a raven caw catch your ear as you glance up into the branches of the cherry blossom tree. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=XrKcdyV0eq4&t=4h17m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
