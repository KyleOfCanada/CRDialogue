<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role this week, where us crazy voice actors play a nerdy game of Dungeons and Dragons! I'm so glad you guys could join us. We had a small hiatus last week as me and Marisha were away at a cool event in the desert, but we're back. I want to give a big thanks and shout-out to Ivan for running that one-shot game last week. Ivan, you kicked ass, you were awesome, and thank you for carrying the torch when we couldn't be here. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">Really appreciate that. And for those who tuned in for him and supporting: thank you guys. Quick little shout-out. We had actually one of our fellow Critters come find us out in the desert this past week. So a shout-out to our friend Scott from Boise, Idaho. Operator, thank you so much for coming and visiting. It was awesome getting to chat with you, and it was cool. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m43s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m43s">Yeah, that was a surrealist experience. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h0m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m44s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m44s">Yeah, we had some cool Critical Role representation out on the Playas. That was really neat. Thank you so much. It was awesome to meet you, Scott, and thanks for coming by. Other fun announcements... This is a cool thing that came up, actually. Hasbro's working with Indiegogo right now to do essentially the search for their new face-to-face party game circumstance. So they're accepting a bunch of submissions right now. I think it's nextgreatgamechallenge.com, but if you're like me and spent a lot of your youth spending your summers designing your own card games and your own board games and your own party games and such that just sat there and did nothing, now is actually a really cool opportunity to submit those and possibly get them published. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m44s">Because the person who wins, wins $10,000 on top of the fact that they get flown out to Hasbro, to the actual company building to work on developing the game with their development team. So that's pretty cool. (laughs) So those of you who have that little game design brain, go ahead and throw your ideas out that way. Submit to this! Hopefully you could win. The thing goes to September 30th? You don't have a whole lot of time, so get on it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m44s">But check it out! A possible opportunity for you to design your own game. Who knows, maybe one day we'll be playing it on this Twitch stream. So check that out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m44s">Also, Welovefine is running a t-shirt design contest for the upcoming Rage of Dragons Dungeons and Dragons release, and they've asked me to be one of the judges of that contest. So all you people with an artistic bone in your body, go ahead and design some t-shirts. Go to welovefine.com, check out the contest rules for the Rage of Demons contest. But I'll be judging your designs! And hopefully if yours is appreciated by me and all the other judges, you'll be getting a cash prize and have your shirts officially sanctioned by D&amp;D and put on welovefine.com, so check that out! That's a cool thing! I've already seen some great art. Some people have floated over to Twitter. If I haven't responded, it's because I'm a judge and I probably shouldn't. (laughs) But everything looks cool, so thank you guys for your submissions. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m40s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m40s">Do you accept cash bribes? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h2m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m43s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m43s">(laughs) No. Other cool announcements. Oh! Once again, every week we have our hundred sub giveaway. Every hundred subs we get, we have a giveaway with somebody randomly within the chat who is actively in the chat. This involves a picture of the cast, signed, one of our posters from our fantastic official artist Kit Buss, signed, and for a few short giveaways, we'll also be giving away a copy of this Pen to Paper Imaginary Friend book that we received, gifted to us by 826LA. It's a book of a collection of stories from the kids that have been tutored at 826LA that told stories about their imaginary friends and what they were like, and their adventures. And they had a lot of talented artists and animators come in and actually illustrate what these imaginary friends look like and what their experiences are with those imaginary friends. So we'll be giving one of these away with each one of those hundred sub giveaways to you guys who have been so gracious in helping support 826LA. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h2m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m43s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m43s">Yes. And we went today! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h3m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m45s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m45s">We went today to 826LA to deliver a nice, big, fatty check to them from you guys, and they were blown away by it. We got to teach a bunch of young kids the basics of Dungeons and Dragons, and we gave them copies of the books to hopefully start a few games of their own there, so thank you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h3m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m1s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m1s">This was such a great experience, and we took video of it, so hopefully we'll have that edited and maybe sometime next week or the week after, you guys can see and learn a little bit about this charity that we support and talk about every week. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h4m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m14s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m14s">Yep, we'll have a cool video up. It'll show you guys our whole experience at 826LA delivering and talking to them about everything, so that'll be fun! Other announcements: This is one of the gifts that we're actually talking about at the start of the stream because we want to utilize it through it. A fantastic gentleman by the name of Jim Donnis sent us custom Vox Machina etched glasses. Customized character glass icons. I have my Dungeon Master glass here. So that's really awesome. And also sent us some really, really nice, quality, expensive dranky-drank. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h4m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m47s">Yeah, I'm one of the Diamond Dog soldiers that you can eventually recruit and play as, and so you can either shoot at me a lot and kill me a lot, or you can run around as me.

<dd id="l0h12m9s">Such children. Responsible for the development and the progression of the guild itself, they found themselves having Pike join them for about a week's time while the landscape of her temple to Sarenrae was being cleansed of a curse, and the group decided to follow through on their promise to aid Keyleth on her Aramente to find the Pyrah people to the far southwest of Vasselheim. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h12m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h12m43s">Ugh. Garlic. Stinking Cloud over there. You thought he wasn't a caster. They made their way to the mountains, eventually to the actual Pyrah tribe itself, where they underwent a trial through the elemental plane of fire. Battled some of the druids, the Pyrah themselves, in elemental fire form, combated against time through a cinder storm as they attempted to escape, and managed to do so with their lives, and in doing so gained the blessing of the Aramente for Keyleth from the Pyrah tribe, as well as a blessing from the main druid as well, as a spark stone. And returned to Vasselheim, Pike then said her goodbyes again, returning to help the restoration of the temple of Sarenrae, and you've all been left to your devices now. So. As you all awaken the next morning within the guildhall itself, your journey and your path is your own to take. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h12m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h26m59s">You are the anti-Wheaton as of late. It's kind of amazing. All right, yeah. You Hunter's Mark one of the Bastions who wanders off in the crowd, and you have a very good idea of where he and/or the cluster that's with him is moving. As you guys progress, following this path that Grog is carving through the crowd, heading for the main bazaar area at the center of the Quad Roads district, heading northwestern, up into the Braving Grounds of Vasselheim, you can also sense that they are following, though at a good 60-foot distance, keeping an eye on the red-scaled dragonborn that then flew out into the open air of the midday sun, with his tinier dragon, his very meta dragon-on-dragon action. You continue pushing into the Braving Grounds area. You can see, now, giant black smokestacks that are billowing up from the various blacksmithies, and there is a large industrial iron complex that is used in the mining and reforming of all the weapons and armor that go to the Bastions of the city here in the Braving Grounds. You make your way up towards the Bellows' Respite Inn, to where the Crucible itself is held in the center. As you approach, it is midday. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h26m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h26m59s">There's no crowd gathered. The Crucible is currently empty and left on its own. You glance about for a second, and there's nobody here running any sort of fight ring. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h26m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You hear the shouts going off the nearby houses; it's echoing, like town crier to town crier. You're hearing voices echo throughout the entirety of the Braving Grounds: people preparing for this midday unexpected throwdown. At this point, you see a few of the Bastions wearing the armor that is geared towards Kord, the god of strength that runs this portion of Vasselheim. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h29m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h30m6s">No, the ones that you're keeping an eye on were from the Quad Roads, and they're still staying back. One of them, the one that you've marked, is around the corner, just keeping an eye on everybody, but he's mainly keeping to himself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h30m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h30m6s">He does stand out like a sore thumb because his armor is darker and based around Erathis, whereas here the Bastions that are under Kord's vision have more of a red, dark, almost rusty look to their armor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h30m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h30m6s">Anyway, as the shouts continue, some of the Kord Bastions gather, one of which you recognize as the one who was acting as the bookie the first time you came to the Crucible. And he looks-- wiping sleep from his eyes-- he looks like he just got into his armor and rushed out here for about ten minutes since you just came out here and shouted your challenge to the sky. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h30m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

At this point now, there's probably about 20, 25 people that are beginning to gather around the outskirts of the Crucible around you. "Oh, it's Philip! Philip's showing down with Kern!" There's all these different whispers now going throughout the crowd as the rest of you gather. The Bastion that you've been following backs off and stays further back, and is slowly keeping a distance further away as the crowd begins to gather, wanting to stay inconspicuous amongst all this chaos and rabble you guys have collected. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h31m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And you see-- you don't see this, because you're down in the Crucible-- you see the crowd, which has probably gathered close to 70 plus people, part, and you see walking over, soot smeared across the front of his face, stepping up is Kern the Hammer, with a bristled, half-orc mustache, a little bit tousled from a day of hard work, sweat glistening off the top of his brow and the top of his head. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h34m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>

However, he's clutching the side of his face, and for the next round, he is blinded. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=0h58m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h18m51s">Eight. All right. You go forward and (pop) your foot finds the side of the knee, and the knee this time buckles under the weight (cracking) off to the side. Kern falls onto one knee, puts both hands out on the ground, and (coughing) coughs up this sputtering puddle of blood that then spills out on the ground. Kern looks like that blow is about to knock Kern over to the side, but Kern sits there and tenses his muscles. His head whips up at you, and that orcish glare, that sheer focus of fury that you saw once before, is holding him on the edge. Kern looks up at you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=1h18m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h26m24s">(smash) With a resounding slam, Kern's body impacts into the stone floor of the Crucible, a cloud of dirt and dust (whoosh) around. Rocks break off and tumble down the side of the walls of the Crucible as the crowd has to stop themselves from falling in from the sheer impact of the tremor that you've left slamming Kern. You can see everyone fall silent; the crowd's cheers all come to a sudden halt. The dust settles. You can see nothing at the base of the Crucible. As the cloud slowly comes to rest, you see there, broken and laid out on the ground is an unconscious, bloodied, and ruined Kern, as Grog steps forward, head hunched beneath his billowing shoulders, fists clenched in anger, victorious in the center of the Crucible. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=1h26m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You see people shouting off, throwing empty coin purses off to the side, different language-- it's a whole cacophony of cheers and curses, and then all of them fall suddenly quiet. The whole crowd turns over to the edge of the Crucible. You see standing over-- let me bring this down here for a moment of tension-- standing over to the edge, a hood is thrown back on a figure that's been watching the entire fight. You notice this figure, as the hood is thrown back: an older human man in his mid- to late-sixties with tough reddish tanned skin. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=1h27m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

His body is stout and ripped as muscle, trained over a lifetime of martial prowess and careful honing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=1h27m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h7m24s">honestly, most of the smithing-based materials and/or workshops they required. The difficult part is finding black powder. It is not refined in this region. It's usually considered almost a byproduct of some of the mining and smelting, and it's very rare to find. Eventually, you find one smithy that gathers it. You're not entirely certain why. And after you give people a couple of examples of the smell of it and what to look for, people send you in this one direction. And you're sent to this one small hovel that is attached to the very base of the mountain that overlooks the entirety of the city, on the far northwestern edge of the Braving Grounds. You come to the door, and it's a very simple, slovenly-kept house. The wood itself is a little warped from the weather; it hasn't kept well, and there's a musty smell of mildew from the outside of the building. But you see a slight glow between the cracks. Apparently, there is some sort of interior light. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=2h7m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h19m21s">Awesome. You guys make your way to the Trial Forge, the large temple to Kord itself. It's once again brilliant to behold. There are steps leading up to the front area: these giant reddish, almost rusted-over looking iron doors that block the front entrance. At the very top of it, you see looming over this entire district is a gargantuan statue of Kord himself. This giant, muscle-bound humanoid titan of a figure, that stands there: giant beard, muscle-bound torso, bracers against the arms, just one knee up. This very heroic pose and just looking over the rest of Vasselheim under his gaze. You see at the front of these iron doors, there are two more Bastions adorned in the same way as the ones that oversaw the battle at the Crucible. One shouts out, "Halt! Ye who approacheth the Trial Forge, what is your business here?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=2h19m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h21m28s">"You'll know." He steps aside and the doors (stone scraping) slide open. As you guys step into the interior, the smell that hits you immediately is that of sage and other burned herbs that are used ceremonially to cleanse a certain landscape of evil spirits, from a superstitious standpoint, but also to build an atmosphere of meditation and understanding. The one Bastion that left and came back and whispered in his ear comes up and leans into you guys and gives you a nod. He doesn't actually speak to you, but he gives you a hand gesture to follow. Leads you into the Trial Forge and you can see now, these halls are essentially one long hallway. It's an arch about 85 to 100 feet up. And the interior of it is built out of a very thick, sturdy reddish stone. You don't know if the actual stone itself is built from a substance of this color, or itself has been stained or colored to match the rest of the Kord reddish aesthetic. But as you step in, your footfalls clack against a black marble floor with what looks like gold streaks through it, almost like there are small veins of some sort of gold material that has been polished within the actual marble itself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=2h21m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h22m42s">However, they are generally a little more dressed down, very simple, as opposed the expressive designs that were billowing across the baggy leggings that the Earthbreaker was wearing. And the robes. As you continue forward, they all step aside and keep a quiet watch, until you begin to notice in the distance, there are two large hallways that intersect. You can see most of the Trial Forge are now two long hallways that intersect into a center piece. And the center place of this temple, there is a raised dais at three different levels. And at the top of it, you can see, there is a beam of light that comes down from above. As you begin to walk towards the structure, you see there is a small figure that is currently sitting on top of this central dais. As you approach the outskirts of this main central chamber where the two long hallways intersect, the quiet Bastion puts his hand out and tells the rest of you to stop. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=2h22m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There is a dark spot in the center, where you can see the shadow from the early afternoon sun is being blocked from the giant statue of Kord that remains at the top of this temple, who is currently, essentially, now looking at the structure, straddling the top of this giant domed stained glass roof, and so underneath this statue is where the top of this structure is, and through it, these beams of light are coming down, multicolored and cascading onto this central chamber. Sitting in the center, you see, cross-legged, arms to the side, eyes closed, there sits Earthbreaker Groon, the Dawn Marshal himself.

You can smell, after the next ten to 15 minutes pass by, that scent of freshly-cooked meats and baking bread begins to fill the air around Greyskull Keep. The halls are kept nice and warm. It's very clean, and it's a very welcome sight to be back home. You take time to rest and exhale and go over the sequence, and as you walk by, you see across the right from the main foyer, you can see a little bit of the light echoing through from the temple of Sarenrae, the stained glass, itself, and for a moment you all take a sad memory of Pike, whereever she is, hopefully to return to you very soon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=2h57m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h59m3s">You sit down and close your eyes and begin to concentrate, and as you begin to focus your energy, the sense of the arcane mind itself has gathered between the center of the head and the center of the chest. You begin to join these in the center, and your consciousness begins to glide downward towards your bowels. Eventually, you find a point of connection and you feel your vision transcending this single point on the prime material plane. You are brought through the small channel across the astral sea to connect, and suddenly your vision takes place. What looks like a cluster of dirt to one side and a darkened chamber that is lit by a series of torches. Before you, you see, still and slightly muddled, the Temple of Sarenrae as partially uncovered. You can see the large stone archway that is the front of the partially collapsed temple. You can see now there is stone being brought down the wooden staircase, and it is being used to slowly build up and reconstruct what was once a beautiful and very well-revered structure. You can see in the distance a small, white-haired gnome figure that is currently acting as foreman for this whole construction process and is giving orders and shouts to the other individuals here. Glancing about, you see her step over, and one person trips and drops a stone, and she walks up to them and takes them by the shoulder and lifts them back up and gives them a little hug, and then picks up the stone and carries it with them over to where it belongs on the side of one of the walls. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FM6L4tuyXq0&t=2h59m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
