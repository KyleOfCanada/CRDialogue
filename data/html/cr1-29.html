<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to this evening's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us voice actors get together and roll dice like we're awesome nerd people, which we are. So, welcome! We're going to do a couple quick announcements here before we kick things off. You want to go ahead and start? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m15s">#</a> <strong>ZAC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m15s">Yeah, I'm that guy that you can't wait to stop talking so the show can get started. So guys, last week we hit 516 on the sub-train. Okay? And each week, in theory, should grow by itself because re-subs count. So basically, if we break 516 and make a new record, we will do a giant giveaway which includes everything from Heroclix to Steam keys to D&amp;D schwag, books from Felicia, all sorts of stuff. It will be a giant box of wonderful Geek and Sundry-related stuff. So that is if we break 516, so there's a reason to keep that train alive, guys. We are also very close to hitting 10k. We are like 160 away from reaching 10,000 subscribers. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h0m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m15s">How many? 154 away from hitting 10k. Now you guys may remember #noshavetil10k. I have not. If we hit 10k, right when we hit, a straw poll will be released into the chatroom, and you guys get to vote on what my face gets shaved into for the next week of programming on G&amp;S. And it is very unfortunate that that's how we're going to do it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h0m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m15s">So tomorrow night on Gather Your Party, it will be Stef and Jessica's birthday, we're going to be throwing a birthday party, and I'm going to let them shave my face in whatever you guys vote on, as a birthday present to them. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h0m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m51s">Can we shave off bits and then re-apply them to other parts of the face? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h1m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m58s">And then this weekend, Nerdist is running a 24-hour livestream for Extra Life. You guys may recognize some of the faces that stop by. They are going to be streaming from our set. So, let's welcome them. We'll be hosting it, but I encourage you guys all to head over to Nerdist, twitch.tv/nerdist. This weekend it'll be Saturday from 9AM to 9PM Pacific Standard Time. I will be there the whole time helping out, as well as some of our other Geek and Sundry hosts. So you guys should check that out and help them be part of our team, raising money for Extra Life. And Matt, I wanted to thank you for helping us make Battle of the Bands a success last week. We all know that the voting was rigged and that's why your team won, but it was a valiant effort nonetheless. And if you guys enjoyed that, you should tweet at Geek and Sundry's twitter and let them know, and we will try to do things like that for you more in the future. That's pretty much all I have. Let's get to 10k and get this stupid stuff off my face. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h1m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m47s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m47s">Thank you very much, Zac. Speaking of shaving, let me take a moment here to mourn the Mercer-beard. Those who saw on twitter. I was trying to hold off until 10k and Halloween for my costume, but due to work, had to shave it as of last night. So, I apologize. I'm in mourning. So please bear with me for this evening, going forward. Couple announcements. Critical Role-related: we have a lot of our party in transit right now. Laura and Travis just flew in from Toronto and will probably be a little bit late to the game. Sam is currently heading here from a session and will get here as soon as possible. Unfortunately, Orion will not be joining us again this evening, but hope to have him back next week for Halloween. So, things will get rolling as they arrive. Thankfully, we're at a situation in the game where I don't think it'll be too halting. We shall see. Next announcement, we're putting out Critical Role thematic playlists. All the players have put together playlists of Spotify songs that they feel encapture aspects of their character and their character's journeying as Vox Machina and in the world of Exandria. So those will be releasing every week, starting tonight at 8PM with Percy, I believe. So Taliesin's playlist will be up available on Geek and Sundry's website and-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h2m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m17s">It's good. Go download Spotify right now, so you can go, if you haven't. It's free! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h4m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m29s">I had a strange day. I've infected friends with Spotify now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h4m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m32s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m32s">As you should. Infecting friends is fun. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h4m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m32s">Couple other things. For those who haven't seen it already, the D&amp;Diesel videos went up earlier this week, where we had the wonderful chance-- for me, at least-- to Dungeon Master for a half an hour for Vin Diesel, along with Travis and Laura, and Jessica and Dan of Nerdist ilk. Had a great time, so hopefully you liked it, and if you'd like to see more stuff like that, hopefully we'll have more things coming up in the future in that vein, because we had a good time. Also, along with that, I released my Witch Hunter class, which was a customized 5th edition class that I designed after I ran that game, based on the character I created for Vin. It went up on the website, untested. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h4m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m32s">Feedback is always welcome, and I will be updating it on the website as feedback comes in and balancing is tweaked for it. But have at it, have fun, hope you guys enjoy it. I had a good time creating it, and it's a good time. Also, just a reminder to you guys: our official Critical Role t-shirts are available on the Geek and Sundry website store if you want to wear any of the awesome red shirts that we've shown on the show with our full-on Critical Role logo. Shown in an exemplary dark, fine ink. Those are available for purchase. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h4m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m55s">What if, due to some strange third-arm syndrome, I can't wear t-shirts; is there any way I can show my support to the show? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h5m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m1s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h6m23s">We have now up on the store our official "How do you want to do this" shirt as well. So you can go check that out on the shop. Prepare for the holiday season with your Christmases and your Chanukahs and your Critmases and all that fun stuff to make people look as nerdy as we are. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h6m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m23s">Which is I think part of my goal, personally, through world domination. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h6m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m48s">Maybe not Liam. Everyone but Liam can look weird. There's no way to help you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h6m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m53s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m53s">Can I just interject for a second only because I'm hot as hell. I just want to thank @pupgames on twitter for making me this fabulous stealthy cloak. I'm going to take it off in about two minutes, because it's more t-shirt weather here in the studio. So I'll just let everybody bask in the glow of my absence of light for two minutes, and then I'm going to switch to t-shirt mode. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h6m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h7m40s">Marisha, you wanted to follow up on the 826LA news you had. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h7m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m43s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m43s">Yes. 826LA, they're in a campaign right now for-- let me try to get all this right-- for LA 2050 which is a big contest that's sponsored by Goldhirsh, right now, and it's all for sponsoring education and a brighter future for Los Angeles. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h7m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m43s">So 826LA and Young Storytellers are actually partnering together, and they're in this contest right now. You have to go vote, and they could potentially win $100,000. Which: awesome. And we've got Critters. I think they'll win. So you have to go vote. I tweeted the link, so the mods, go find it on my twitter, or you can just search #LA2050, and you should be able to find it. So, yeah, go vote. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h7m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h12m35s">Well played. So. To give us a little overview of the current story. Two nasty individuals known as the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, have, for the past five years, been occupying the city of Whitestone, which was once the home to Percival here, after it was forcefully taken from his family, most of which seemingly have been either killed or lost in the process, and he was scattered to the four winds to find Vox Machina. After encountering the Briarwoods in Emon in a scuffle that took place, the Briarwoods retreated to Whitestone, inviting the party to come and say hello. Since then, the party has prepared the best they could, made their way towards Whitestone, and, through some bit of infiltration and subterfuge, managed to sneak into the city itself. They, under the guise of Scanlan's Seeming illusion, appeared to be as common folk as the rest of the poor saps that still live in Whitestone. They scoped out an abandoned tavern, which they fitted to their needs as a base of operations, and also managed to come across a central portion of Whitestone's city structure and history, known as the Sun Tree, a tree once risen to the might of the god of the sun, Pelor, now lies dead in the center of town, and from it hung eight figures that appear to have been individuals killed, hung, and painted up and dressed to resemble Vox Machina as essentially a warning, or a welcome. It's hard to tell when it comes to the Briarwoods. Nevertheless, a message was definitely delivered. The party, retreating back to the tavern, set up for the remainder of the afternoon. Keyleth carved, through her druidic magical ways, through the ground to find some of the roots of the Sun Tree, and began preparing an extensive, time-consuming ritual in hopes of restoring some semblance of life to the entity itself. That is where we left off. While the rest of you have been going about your preparations for the rest of the afternoon as this ritual for Keyleth is an eight-hour ritual and it begun in the early afternoon around 2:00, so this will conclude by around sundown, a little past sundown. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h12m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m35s">While she is down there, essentially meditating with the barren roots of the Sun Tree, is there anything you guys would wish to do, or are you just waiting for her to complete her ritual? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h12m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h15m50s">Nine. Honestly, it's hard to tell if it's a curse, the tree itself is just dead. You are very well-connected with the natural essences of the world, the life essence of plants and natural growth. All of your interactions with the Sun Tree are devoid of any response. It seems dead where it stands. But, as you continue your ritual-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h15m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you guys make your way through, staying off to the side, jumping, or running through buildings and staying off the main path, you walk along the central road to the far eastern side of Whitestone. A few folks come out during the day, some are carrying bundles of textile goods. There's one guy that has a small cart, and it looks like he's bringing tools and stuff either to or from a store of some kind.

There is the multiple exit points throughout this wall. You dart around the outskirts of it, being careful to avoid the pattern of the undead giants that are slowly stomping through the city, like these hulking sentinels that walk in a perpetual pattern through the town. You follow the winding path through the thick woods, just on the outside of the wall of the city itself. You sticking to the path in your open way, or do you want to join them in the side of the forest? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h25m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The older stones have very little rhyme or reason to their placement. They're sporadically thrown around, fresher ones tend to be more clustered with family names.

It looks almost like the outer ring of the classical depiction of a sun and going across the sky where you can see the waving flames licking the sides of the actual doors. And it is a double door. As you tug on the handle at the front, it gives very little to you. You give a little more of a tug on it, not enough to gather attention, just enough to really see if it's just stuck, or if it's locked.

On the other side you hear this muffled (spoof) as he reappears on the opposite side, completing his transition. You appear now in the central worship hall of the Zenith temple. To each side of you, you can see there are windows, about ten foot wide, stained glass windows, about every ten feet around this pattern, it looks like three to each side. There are pews set up for the masses to come and sit and worship, but a lot of the pews have been pushed off to the side, set astray, some have been destroyed and ruined. There's a pile in the corner of a number of sundered and tattered pews. There is a red carpet that marks the center that goes all the way to what looks like a raised altar on the opposite side of the room. You can see that some of the stained glass further down has been shattered and broken, and a little bit of sunlight creeps through. You can see there is on the altar a large stone platform. It's hard to see from this distance. Make a perception check. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h31m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It looks elven by racial nature, but the eyes are just these sunken faintly glowing sockets, the hair wild and matted and floating behind it, its hands reaching out, and as it gets partway through the temple, it looks like it's seeking something, and its eyes fall directly on you two. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=0h52m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h15m2s">All right. As you guys are making your way back towards the tavern, there is a small group of Whitestone villagers walking and having a conversation. Not heated, but there is a sense of desperate conversation amongst them. And, standing with them you can see there's an older gentleman, mostly bald, long scraggly gray hair that falls past his shoulders, a little bit hunched. He's wearing dark leathers and a cloak that's over one shoulder and drags the ground behind him. And they're talking to him and he's growling to himself and the best you can make out is there's an argument about farming shipments and the inability to make dates and requirements. He shouts back to the remainder, says, "Listen, it is beyond my control. This is what has been decreed "by Sir Kerrion. That is how it'll be. If you cannot provide, then taxes will be pulled. If you "cannot pay, then there are far worse things we can take. Now, be on your way!" And steps away from the group, looks over and sees a little boy and this in the shadows skulking individual.

As you release it you begin to concentrate on the sun ray and you begin to see, throughout the pieces of earth around, seeds quickly begin to germinate and small little bits of ivy, greenery begin to pierce out from parts of the earth in your immediate vicinity, as this affects a large radius. There does not appear to be any sort of immediate reaction by the tree. You begin to pull back and concentrate on the spell. You release the Sunbeam forward. In the frustration of the lack of reaction from the tree and the desperation to make sure some effect happens, you release the full force of the beam as opposed to the prequel aspect and you burst into some of the roots, blasting some of them apart and beginning to set flame to part of the under of the tree. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h20m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h29m20s">As you guys take your watches and go to sleep in the cold interior, and it is a cold interior of the tavern. As the night comes through, this is your first time really staying the night in the center of Whitestone. Even though you slept in the forest, in the boughs of the trees itself, the temperature grows far colder here, and even with the warm interior, the windows frost over and you find yourselves having to huddle or build some sort of small fire to even keep a semblance of comfort to rest. You all eventually go to sleep throughout your various times. I would like everyone to make a wisdom saving throw. With advantage, because you're still affected by the Heroes' Feast. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h29m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Not quite rain, but not quite drizzle, but just a mist in the air. It's a cold day. The ground and most of the walkways and roads are a little damp due to the moisture in the air. Not muddy, just a little bit of a packed wetness to it. As you head over towards Beyond the Horizon, and that lies more in the northwestern quadrant of the city. A little ways around the street from one of the noble houses, so you keep a wide berth. You come to the row of shops that bookended it before, and you go to the curiosity shop to find that the building itself is partially collapsed and ruined. The door is torn off the hinges and left to the side. Part of the ceiling is fallen in. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h44m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h48m36s">Okay. So you skirt back towards the the crossroad, the nearest crossroad that heads northward to the very, very far northwest section of Whitestone. There you come to this noble house, which has a nice bronzed fence around the outside of it. Probably about seven feet tall with these intricate spears affixed to the top, almost in a fleur-de-lis type pattern, but looks sharp enough to keep anyone from trying to leap over. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h48m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h48m36s">The front gate is currently chained off with a lock on it. There is a lawn, but the lawn itself appears to be frost-crusted from the evening's moisture and cold temperature. What grass is there is very gray and dull and currently crisp with a white frost dew. Is a slight hill, and you do see the building itself. It's a very nice building. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h48m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h48m36s">It's a deep brown. A lot of it appears to be like natural stained wood from the local forest surrounding Whitestone, with highlights of deep green and black. There does not appear to be any immediate sign of life from the inside, but there does appear to be a light coming from the inside, so even at this point in the day, it can be dark on the interior. You can see a little bit of light coming from one of the doors. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h48m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h56m58s">All right, so. You make your way southward to probably what's the second largest road intersection in this city. Away from the Sun Tree square. You can now see the temple to Erathis here. And it is a large stone half dome amphitheater set up where it's built outward to face the actual crossroads. And there is a courtyard built around it, a small stone wall about three feet tall, that encapsulates this area. There is a couple of trees, but there isn't a lot of grass, most of it's just stonework-- Erathis being the goddess of civilization. You know, it has an interesting duality and disrespect to Melora and all unbridled nature. Things that are controlled and civilized are definitely her realm of expertise. But as you approach, like most of the grass here, it's pretty desolate and dead. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h56m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h56m58s">Winter is definitely making its way to this part of the city. You do notice that surrounding it, there is dried ivy, and just a general feeling of solemn desperation and sadness. There are a few people scattered throughout sitting on benches, sitting in quiet contemplation. Some of them are clutching small holy symbols and doing a prayer to themselves while rocking in the bench. You do see within the dome, there is a group of about four people that are all sitting, looking up to a man, an older man with a thick, white mustache and receding white hair. His gray robes he's wearing look weathered. You recognize him. While you haven't had too much interaction, not being much of a pious man, in any form of religion from your history, but you do know, Keeper Yennen is the head priest of Erathis here and is currently giving the tail-end of a small sermon to those here. Hearing him, he speaks words of comfort talking of, through these dark days, we must bind together as a community. We have to ensure that our livelihood and our existence is kept, and we look out for our fellow man. There is solace in the friendships and bonds we keep here. And best not to upset those that wish to keep us down. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h56m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h56m58s">Erathis looks over us. There will be a time in which our salvation will come. And he goes into this very rallying speech and trying to lift the spirits of those around. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=1h56m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

If not here at Whitestone, one day we will all go past these boundaries, these borders, and create our own cities. There is hope for this. And then begins to go into a couple of familiar prayers tailored specifically to the Erathis way of thinking, and then finishes and everyone looks up, bows their heads for a second and begin to stand up and walk away from the amphitheater as he turns around and begins to clear off one of the back benches for him to sit on. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=2h0m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Two regular leather-armor looking, more thugs than guards, but they're just both keeping under the overhang at the front porch to keep dry and grimacing at the weather. There is a gate around it. This gate is more for purpose than visual presentation. It's a black iron, nasty, jagged, rusty-looking gate. Not too dissimilar to the one that surrounded the graveyard.

<dd id="l2h15m18s">All right. I will say above 20s, you guys notice there is a cellar door outside the building that descends beneath it. There's no indicator as to whether or not it's attached to the house or if it's just an exterior cellar that you can enter from the outside. You do also see there are a number of windows around the household that are all currently closed that lead into the interior. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gq4av949-3Y&t=2h15m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>

If what Lady Briarwood says, we should be having visitors any day now. And I would "hate to be caught flat-footed.
