<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">I think this is our 24th episode, which is ridiculous. We've been doing this since March, and it gets more and more ridiculous every week. Glad you guys can join us. The new guys, welcome to our chaos. For all the old folks, glad you could come and join us again. Quick thing I want to mention: last week we were talking about the changes to Critmas, because we had stresses on scheduling and we had crew here, and when things go long, we were talking about possibly moving to Periscope on a different day, separate medium. Well, the fanbase has spoken very loudly and very intently about their reaction to that, and so what we're doing, to still make it so people aren't kept here for ridiculous hours weekly, we're still going to have Critmas on the stream, but it's going to be once a month. It's probably going to be the first Thursday of every month, and we're going to make it an extensive day for that month where we open everything that evening. We still get to experience and share that with you guys, but also not keep these guys here way too late unpaid every Thursday night. So I think that's the plan we're going with forward. Hopefully, that's cool with everyone, because we love it, too, and we want to make sure we still share that with you guys. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">All right, couple of other announcements. First and foremost, I wanted to mention again-- we mentioned it last week, as well-- there's that Hasbro game design contest, design the next party game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">That's still up until end of this month, I believe. So if you want to check it out, you can go ahead and tweet at me, last week's episode or search for the Hasbro game design contest. That's still happening. Also, there's a film series that I'm a part of called Mythica. It's like a high fantasy film series where I play the main villain, the necromancer Zorloc. It's fun times. It's like awesome, fun, fantasy genre film. And they're currently putting up a Kickstarter to finish the post on the third film, so you should check that out. Search Mythica on Kickstarter and you should find it there. Also, WeLoveFine is still running their DND t-shirt contest for their Rage of Demons release for Wizards of the Coast, where you can submit your own t-shirt designs that fit within the Rage of Demons theme. I am one of the judges on that, so if you submit your art to this, there is a cash prize. All the rules are up there on the WeLoveFine contest site. And I'll be able to judge your artwork and hopefully put you through to the end. So there's that. Trying to get through these as fast as possible. Our TeeSpring shirt for Is It Thursday Yet? is still up. It has one more week. So if any of you guys want to get the limited edition Critical Role Is It Thursday Yet? shirt, that is only available for one more week and then it'll be gone forever, so get it while you can. Let's see. I'm doing my best to get through this as fast as possible. No worries. Not everything. Also, Ashley's show Blindspot is premiering this coming Monday. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">(cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m12s">Which is so exciting. You can check out Ashley on Blindspot where she'll maybe be sneaking Critical Role stuff into the show, hopefully. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h3m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m12s">We're trying to push her to do that. So you should go support her. See it. It's awesome. And all of us lament that's the reason she's away from us. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h3m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m12s">Someone want to handle our other cool-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h3m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m33s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m33s">But it's not on us yet. Oh look, now you can see us. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h3m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m39s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m39s">Why don't I go, and then you can go. Hey, you guys. I just want to make sure all of you are aware-- this is going to be so awkward-- I want to make sure you're all aware of a Kickstarter that's out there that is put up by a good friend of mine named Joe Madureira. Now if you don't know who Joe is, he is a comic book rock god and a game developer. When I was a teenager, he made a comic book called Battle Chasers. Look, here's mine. From when I was 16, Joe. I fell in love with it. Nobody does art like Joe Mad does, and I've followed his art for years and years. Even when I fell out of comic books, I was checking in with Hellboy and I was checking in with Joe Mad. And then, years later, I got cast in a game called Darksiders as one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. I played War, and I walked into the room and Joe Mad was in the fucking room, and then we became friends. So that game was amazing. Darksiders is a beautiful game. It just reeked of Joe's art style and now he has formed another company called Airship Syndicate and they have a Kickstarter up. They are making a game called Battle Chasers. Oh shoot! I didn't put the thing that comes-- oh, Nightwar! Battle Chasers: Nightwar. They've already hit their goal, but there are stretch goals. They are making an RPG, sort of in the ilk of JRPGs, like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. And it's just going to be bathed in the glory of Joe Mad's amazing art style. So they've hit their goal, but the bigger the budget, the better the game is going to be. I backed it already. And you guys should at least go check it out. A lot of love for Joe Mad. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h3m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m23s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m23s">Yeah, me too. I'm on the same end. I knew Joe Mad through meeting Liam for a while, and later realizing that this guy I knew as an amazing voice director and an amazing producer has inked some of my favorite issues of Excalibur, and I crapped my pants. I have four of yours, Joe, in my box right now at home. He's an amazing guy and awesome thing to back. Check it out, please. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h5m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m52s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h12m42s">Pike left back there to finish up the renovation of the temple of Sarenrae that was discovered. The rest of the party moved on back to Emon, the rest of their business complete. Within Emon, they returned to Greyskull Keep, where they encountered a fan, apparently, of Vox Machina, that had been camping for two weeks outside, who was promptly bludgeoned in the temple by Vax to teach him a lesson. Brought back from the brink, and taught that hard lesson-- that this is a dangerous field-- managed to seemingly reach out and touch the heart of this young, intrepid, wannabe adventurer to possibly try and better himself before he throws himself into danger's way. And he ran off to train harder. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h12m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Upon returning to the keep, notice was sent off to one of the other members of the Council of Tal'Dorei, Seeker Asum, who is the halfling head of whispers and all sorts of subterfuge across the countryside, who came to you notifying you that within a week's time, the Briarwoods, Lord and Lady Briarwood, are supposed to be arriving here within Emon for a feast to discuss building a bridge and a more political joining between Emon, the Tal'Dorei royal family, and these up-and-coming lords and ladies, who have a very dark history with Percy's character. You've been asked to join as part of this feast as you previously requested with sovereign Tal'Dorei, that should anything involved the Briarwoods that you be included. You have a week to figure out what you want to do in advance of that. And that is where we left off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=0h13m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You can see the marble itself has these carvings and sculptures of various dead-looking faces of long-passed mages that either were built or held in high esteem in the halls of this lyceum. At the very end, it opens up into a pretty well-decorated, almost over-the-top decorated office room for the headmaster himself. The interior is lined with large, large 15, 20-foot-tall bookshelves around this oval room with sliding ladders that are attached to them that slowly glide on their own, like they're on some sort of arcane-based pattern that puts them back and forth. There is a large chandelier of brightly colored orbs that sits 35, 40 feet in the air, that slowly rotates on its own that keeps this slowly fluctuating changing color of the room. And in the center there is a circular desk, and sitting there at the desk you can see is Headmaster Thurmond, who is this extremely elderly human male. Shaved face, very short, curved bald head with a little bit of hair in the back, hunched forward and is currently collecting a series of books into his arms. Looks like he's about to get up.

There are a couple of small knick-knacks and toys that are discarded underneath that have been there for a while that lead you to believe that this was at one point a boy's room. However, what you do notice is that most of the materials, most of the belongings, anything that you would normally see in a boy's room, anything that would say that a person lives here seem to have been hastily grabbed and taken off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=1h37m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h27m3s">There is a large channel where these two large mountain ranges, which are the closest the two continents are to each other, but it's a very treacherous pass of water, so any trade having to be done has had to travel southward, in a big arc around the bottom of the island, or via skyship, both very expensive. This bridge will enable a much faster trade route between the two continents, and Whitestone has essentially been in charge of spearheading the construction of this bridge and making this agreement with Uriel, that would be overall helpful for both continents. And since they've agreed upon this, they've been invited here to Emon for the first time to have dinner with the Council and Uriel to celebrate it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=2h27m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h59m10s">All right. You guys head back out to the front of the palace, the large stairway that leads down into the central road outside of the palace in the middle of the Cloudtop district. The sky itself has now come to a dark purple blue slowly moving over into the distant sunset. The sun has disappeared beneath the sea and you've completed the dusk as the sunset slowly turns gold. A dark wood carriage flanked by four armored men on horseback pulls onto the road right before the Tal'Dorei palace. A young man steps from the front of the carriage and opens the door. Stepping out you see a strong, tall man in the nearby lantern light. Short brown hair frames a very chiseled and handsome face adorned with a well groomed goatee. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=2h59m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h59m10s">His clothing is based in blue and black, fitted elegance trimmed with golds and red. A strip of grey fur cresting over one shoulder framing his torso. He turns, extends his hand towards the door, where a feminine gloved hand finds it. A beautiful woman steps out after. Her hair dark auburn and pulled up into a tight braided bun, resembling some sort of a glamorous school teacher almost. Her gown is in the same color scheme as the man, if a bit heavier blue than black, and a long billowing skirt tapers up to be form-fitted across her body, continuing upward to wrap her neck nearly to the jaw. They both turn to face the greeting party, bowing slightly as two of their companion guards flank their approach up the steps. The other two helping the young man who steered the carriage carry their rather large bags behind them. This is Lord Sylas Briarwood and Lady Delilah Briarwood. As you guys are standing here at this point, stepping behind you a hand reaches over and touches the back of your shoulder. You look behind you and there, smiling, is Arcanist Allura Vysoren dressed in a very fine blue gown. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=2h59m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Someone you may have crossed paths with in the past but nobody that's really been formally involved in your life previously. Maybe a denizen of Whitestone that you've crossed before when he was younger. As they walk up the steps, you keep an eye best you can as they go. You catch a little bit of conversation that seems to speak about how long the journey's been, "That's all right, we'll be in there soon to discuss and we'll be out as soon as we can. We "won't stay any longer than we need to." And that's the extent you gather as they continue up the stairway.

<dd id="l3h7m49s">The two of you scanning over. Looking over there is Lord Riskel Daxio, he's an elven male, who was the one who is master of trade of the city. He's the one that handled the ordering of your keep when you first had it brought to your attention by Uriel. Allura, of course. Tofor Brotorus is there, the female dragonborn paladin. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=3h7m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h7m49s">She seems generally just not happy about the whole scenario and she's not armored, she's dressed in what would be considered formal attire but it's not a dress, it's not a suit, it's this asexual formal outfit that looks like a robe but also like a suit and she does not look to be happy in it at all. Just arms crossed, at the far end, back against the wall just (growling noises) slowly stewing, not wanting to be there. You also see Arbiter Brom Goldhand, who is the master of law. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=3h7m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h7m49s">Was previously one of the heads of the guard there within Emon and then was then given the job of being the head of the Watchful Hall. He's the master of law essentially in the city. That's right, Tofor is the master of defense that took over for Krieg after Krieg was slain. So those are the council members. Most everyone else there you see are servants. As time goes on eventually there is the ringing of a dinner bell down the hallway and everyone turns their head and notices and steps over to the great hall of the palace where the feast is to be given to you and other guests. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=3h7m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>

She asks questions about why Pike isn't here and you tell her the story that she stayed behind and everything. You make your way into the great hall which seats a vast number of people.

<dd id="l3h11m58s">They both wordlessly sit down, smiling and acknowledge everyone at the table. There's a moment of silence and then another servant says "And would all please attention be given to our sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei the second and the "Empress Salda Tal'Dorei." At which point, the sovereign and his wife enter from the same entrance point. Everyone stands up from their chair, waits for them to get to the edge of the table, at which point they nod their head. Everyone gives a low bow. You guys follow suit, following the social graces you're not familiar with but trying to learn as you go. Except for Tiberius, you know this deal.

<dd id="l3h11m58s">Uriel looks about the table with a smile, shoulder length brown hair and his chin goatee very well crafted into almost a point now. He looks about the table. "Thank you, Lord and Lady Briarwood, "for making the journey across the lands so that we might meet in person, finally. Please, allow me to "introduce our dining party and esteemed council of Tal'Dorei." He goes around the table introducing, "Arbiter Brom Goldhand. He is the master of law of our city, and is responsible for maintaining all "of these grand people of our fair town in the realm of safety and order. We have Lord Riskel "Daxio. He is our head of planning and construction; has overseen many of the expansions "of the city, and is a trusted friend of mine. We have the Arcanist Allura Vysoren: one of my "trusted advisors, one of the greatest arcane minds of all of Tal'Dorei, and the overseer of all "things arcane within our city. We have the Guardian Tofor Brotorus, a fierce warrior and "currently the master of defense in our city and hopefully for a long time to come." Tofor gives a (scoffs) sound and everyone is put off by it, but they're also seemingly used to it. "Arbiter Brom "Goldhand: master of law. My lovely wife, the Empress Salda. We have here within our midst, as "well: Vox Machina, a team of intrepid adventurers who rose up and saved my family's life and very "well the city of Emon and have since proven very useful to our territory. Grog Strongjaw, a goliath "of interesting dress, but strong of heart and blade. We have Vex'halia, half-elven maiden with a "bow as swift as the fastest eagle." Looking next, he says, "We have here Vax'ildan, blades quick and "eyes sharp, not a whisper passes his ear. Ah! There you are! Scanlan Shorthalt, a performer "known far and wide.

<dd id="l3h16m41s">Immediately conversation builds in about Uriel talking across to the Briarwoods talking about the bridge. He says "Now, the Uriel bridge, I don't think the name was necessary, but it's appreciated "from my perspective. Now in this union between Wildemount and Tal'Dorei-- do we have a confirmed "trade route between the two?" At which Lord Briarwood returns, "This is indeed very true. We are hoping that through this "passageway, we'd have means of rather quick trade between this kingdom and yours. Not to mention "this would allow for individuals to travel for carried parcels very quickly and we're hoping to "establish perhaps a very quick means of communication outside of the arcane for those who "cannot afford these various luxuries." Lady Briarwood taps on his shoulder and says, "Yes, and by the way, I don't mean to bring up a sore "subject but it's come to our attention that apparently last Winter's Crest, there was an "attempt on your life," and the table gets a little quiet for a second. "We're sorry to hear that and "wish to express our--" Uriel puts his hand out and says, "No, no, it's quite all right. It was but a paltry attempt, and "it was thwarted actually by Vox Machina.

And since then we've had many different years "we've spent together as families going on various journeys and trips together.

They were in the process "of discussing the building of the Uriel bridge about five years ago, and we were going to meet "with them about pursuing this venture as a joint-- well, when the disease took them.

In the center of the room, you see, on top of the rug, against the wall between the two windows is a large canopy bed, very beautifully carved from dark wood, has a purple cloth silk canopy that drifts down around it. And on the far end, you can see now, against one of the tables, is Lady Briarwood is currently taking jewelry off of one of her arms while Lord Briarwood is right by the bed, holding on to the post, like he's just walked over to that area. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kre27f30IVs&t=3h43m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
