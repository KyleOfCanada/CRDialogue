<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">(whooping and cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m9s">Anyway! Before we hop into tonight's episode, we have some quick announcements to get through so bear with us. First and foremost, we have our fantastic friends of old returning to cosponsor tonight's episode: our friends at Backblaze. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m25s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m25s">That's right, Backblaze-- Is the camera on me? The camera is on me! Backblaze, guys, you know them. Backblaze backs up all of your data, movies, music, video, cosplay designs, character sheets, fanart, more for just five dollars a month-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m37s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m37s">Five dollars? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m38s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m38s">I use the service. No gimmicks. No add-ons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m38s">No gotchas. Works on Mac and PC. They also have the option to restore by mail. Backblaze will send you a physical hard drive! Yes and it is hardcore. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m38s">I don't know. They backed up over 35 billion files. They're legit. Go to backblaze.com/criticalrole to check it out. Start your free trial now and let them know you're coming from our show. This will also, this is the important part, be Backblaze's last sponsorship for a while. It's a little bittersweet so please, if you're are going to go show them some love, now is the time to do it. Go to backblaze.com/criticalrole. Yev, our fantastic friend from Backblaze, wanted to say thanks to the entire cast and crew for being so awesome and welcoming and a very special thanks to me, Sam, for all the effort I put into the ad reads. Aww. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m38s">So to thank him, I wrote two songs. I'll only sing one but I'm going to give it to the cast-- the cast can decide which one. Do you want to hear Spice Girls or Golden Girls? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h0m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h2m8s">Backed up all my shit again and again. Your app is true. You're a pal and you pay for our show. And if I nuked my laptop, viruses fill the whole thing up with porn. I would see you and you'd send my hard drive back to me and the card attached would say, "Thank you being our Yev." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h2m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h2m51s">In case you missed it, they've launched their new show, "Heroes of the Vale". We talked about it last week a bit. DMed by the fantastic Mike Mearls, designer of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fifth Edition at Wizard of the Coast, amongst some of the great members of the team. He is DMing his own world, Nentir Vale. I'm familiar with it from fourth edition. It's actually a really cool world. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h2m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m51s">An amazing cast-- friend of the show TJ Storm, Todd Kenreck, friend of ours at D&amp;D Beyond, Shelly Mazzanoble, a bunch of other amazing people on the show. Check it out. I think their second episode just went up recently, which is awesome. It's every Wednesday at 2pm Pacific time on twitch.tv/dndbeyond and you can follow it @DnDBeyond on Twitter as well. This is the last month to use coupon code SamIsYourHero. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h2m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m49s">League of Legends, PUBG, Fortnite, DOTA 2 and as opposed to the regular announcer, you get to have "me tell you when you kill somebody, 'Poor fella.'" Or when you lose a match being like, "Oh, maybe you should have rolled a paladin." So yeah, we did a whole shit ton of variations. This Saturday is a video stream of me and Taliesin here playing Fortnite for the first time for both of us! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h4m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h9m22s">Yeah we did. For over five months, Sam and I worked with some extremely talented animators in the Philippines. We have to give massive props and love to Kamille and Kevin Areopagita. They are absolutely brilliant. You can check out their twitter page at @karekareo. Their patreon is there. Go. Give them both love. Support their patreon. They are far too talented to not be doing more.

<dt><a href="#l0h13m39s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h13m39s">So last we left off, the Mighty Nein, after being pulled through a series of pirate adjacent and straight up pirate adventures across the Swavain Islands here in the Lucidian ocean, on the ship, the Squalleater, under the Captain Avantica's rule, you made your way to Darktow where you attempted to find a way to discredit her. Find a way to not be dragged into her business in the future. It got a little messy but you managed to avoid it coming to too terrible a head until you are brought into her ship last week where a battle unfolded, in which most of you managed to skitter away with the contents of this journal that you had taken from her as well as the translation for the cipher that was used to write it. Managed to make your way to the Plank King in time and have him bring his resources to the docks before any more of you could be further destroyed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h13m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m39s">Summoning a demon helped as part of the distraction, as well as patiently waiting. Some quick thought process moments. You guys did pretty damn well. You managed to just break enough laws to be put not in favor of the Plank King but managed to have done a large favor enough to be let leave and never return. Taking the hobbled ship that you guys had busted with you, you made your way out into the open ocean, heading northeast from Darktow and the Dragshallow Reef, in search of the possible shipwreck that started Fjord's destiny in the direction of Uk'otoa. After days of travel and a few location spells cast, you managed to find a blip at the base of the sea. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h13m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m39s">Using your newfound ability to instill the ability to breathe water within the party around you, you sunk to the bottom, holding onto cannonballs, and began to walk the bottom floor in search of the shipwreck, eventually coming upon a valley caldera that slowly sinks down. You noticed, aside from the whale that just skimmed your presence, the bow of a derelict, wrecked ship sitting there, surrounded by seaweed in the barely-visible, creeping daylight making it this deep in the waters. So with your lights aglow and the wreck before you, Mighty Nein, what do you want to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h13m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The edges of the cargo hold that are blown open-- as soon as you begin to peer in the inside, you can see the interior is blackened as well, amongst the other patches of sea life that have begun to reclaim it as a home, and bits of seaweed, and general sea vegetation that has begun to find its way inside the empty ship. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h26m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Where it was forced open, there are some heavy claw marks along the edges where the metal itself looks scarred. The interior, as you pull it open and look inside, is set with a leather recess on each side, top and bottom, soft leather with two halves that are somewhat spherical, like to hold a small apple. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=0h36m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

In the middle of this chamber, there is a small two-foot pedestal and a disc, a stone disc about that wide and about two feet from edge to edge that is resting on it but at an angle. It looks old. It looks weathered and there appears to be a spiral of runes, two sets of them, that curve inward around each other before merging in the center with one singular sigil where they meet. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8UVu-kGusg&t=2h28m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
