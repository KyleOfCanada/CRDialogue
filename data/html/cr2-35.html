<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m8s">Before we get into tonight's game, we have some announcements to get through, so be patient with us for a moment as we give a big shout out and thanks to our two sponsors for tonight's episode, starting with our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h0m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m18s">As I said last week, the Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is now available on D&amp;D Beyond. As Max said last week. They'll guide your Waterdeep campaign from levels one to five. After that, explore the legendary Undermountain Dungeon below the city with Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage for levels five through 20! Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage is available for pre-order on D&amp;D Beyond and will release November 2nd. Now, because D&amp;D Beyond is such a generous sponsor of this show, Laura, I wanted to show the audience some of what we do with that sponsorship money. We take it and we turn it into this amazing studio which has amazing equipment and after effects and editing suites and cool special effects, so we put together a really cool ad for them using all the equipment, and if you guys would turn to the monitor and see what we made. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h0m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m20s">Hi, guys! As you know, we love D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h1m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m20s">It's easy to use, the interface is super high tech. Since their sponsorship helps us make this show, we thought we'd use all the cutting edge editing software in our fabulous new studio to make D&amp;D Beyond a mind-blowing special effects ad. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h1m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m20s">(explosions) Explosions, I assume. For instance, look at my face. Looks normal now, right? But when we add high tech CGI effects: Oh, I look like a beholder! Roar! Antimagic cone! D&amp;D Beyond! Okay, reset. Now, check out this awesome face swapping feature. Okay, right now, I look like Sam Riegel. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h1m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m20s">But now (whoop). Oh, I'm Matt Mercer. Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors get to look at how handsome I am. Oh, now I'm doing a Cajun accent. Okay, reset. But that's not all. Now, it looks like I'm holding nothing, right? But now, with special effects. (gasp) Oh! I've got an adorable blink dog in my hands. Aw, isn't Nugget so cute? And reset. Wow, that was just a taste of the amazing special effects that D&amp;D Beyond sponsorship covers here at the studio. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h1m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m20s">Thanks, D&amp;D Beyond, and if you don't mind, Scotty, beam me up! I'm probably gone by now, right? That was great! Thanks, Max. I can't wait to see how it cuts together. I can't wait to see all the effects. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h1m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Returning is our friend here, The Rook and The Raven, who have been doing their awesome-- if you guys aren't familiar, haven't seen the previous episodes-- these really awesome, high quality, discbound gaming notebooks for your campaign. The fronts, you can see, are laser etched designs of awesome maps from our fantastic friend, Deven Rue, who did our Dwendalian Empire map earlier in the campaign, which you saw, and just came into stock, apparently. This is their Mischief and Misadventure book where you can go ahead and put all your campaign notes and your character info. It's pretty badass. Their Kickstarter ends tonight at midnight Pacific time, so if you haven't got in on it, now's your last chance to do so. This is your last chance to get the deluxe edition of this, as well as the Far Traveler's notebook at the Kickstarter exclusive pricing, so get to it now if you're planning to. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h7m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m22s">Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein had found their way outside of the Dwendalian Empire and to the first city along the coast of the Menagerie Coast, Nicodranas, where Fjord had passed through previously on his various adventures through the waters nearby, and Jester's upbringing was entirely within. You had met with Jester's mother, Marion, The Ruby of the Sea, as well as began to seek information about an individual that was connected with your time up at Shadycreek Run and the sphere that you had absorbed, Fjord. In this period of time, you discovered there was an individual that had grown jealous and strangely aggressive regarding the companionship of Jester's mother and as such, you began to seek information about them in a way to put an end to this behavior. In doing so, you went to a tavern and met a captain who had possibly room for a few of you to travel with about a week from now. You met a tortle-- for many of you, the first time you've encountered a tortle-- who had some interesting things to say and a lead on the individual you were looking for. You also found information about what's called the Sluice Weave, a series of waterways beneath the city where this Algar, this individual that was creating tension with The Ruby of the Sea, works and oversees. You made your way to the outskirts of the docks, searched through the water for an entrance, managed to muscle your way through the grates below, nearly drowning the pets you had recently purchased. You encountered a few small water elementals and eventually came upon one of the nexus areas of this waterway where there was an elemental entity named Xundi that was bound to this location and was helping run and control the water in and out, under the supervision of Algar. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h10m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m22s">Catching them, but, however, not being as stealthy as you had hoped, you were noticed, and as such, a battle commenced where Xundi, this elemental figure, was given the command by Algar to take care of you and see you out. In this fray, a number of you fell and fell again, but through a combination of Fjord's teleportation spell abilities, you guys keeping each other alive, you repeatedly punching very hard whatever got in your way, you managed to subdue Algar, destroy his two guards, raised one as a specter, and noticing that there was something affixed to his wrist that seemed to have some connection with Xundi, Fjord cut his left hand off. And that's where we pick up. The rest of you are slowly pulling your way, your bodies are completely waterlogged from rushing through thigh-high waters and many of you being submerged-- nearly drowned at times. You gather yourself as you realize the threat is gone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h10m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m22s">The water elemental's destroyed, and this entity that was once attacking you seems to have lowered their trident and turned around, their attention elsewhere, releasing any aggressive demeanor they have held since your arrival. At this time, you, Beau, as you turn the corner and mashed the face of Algar against the wet stone wall, you look over to see both Fjord slice the hand off of his right wrist-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=0h10m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h26m54s">Yeah. There are torch poles set up towards the wharf that are giving a faint bit of light, but other than that, it's not a full moon, but it's mostly full and there's quite a bit of moonlight coming down over the dock. You can see it glittering across the water in the center of the harbor. There are a number of ships quietly set out in that vicinity. The star-clustered sky completely envelopes the air above you. It's a beautiful view. The closer you get to the docks, you can hear the sound of waves crashing from out of view, the creaking of wet wood filling the air as the docks shift and the number of boats that are currently moored to the center of the harbor creak from side to side as the water comes in. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=1h26m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h26m54s">Every now and then, you see the slow glowing beam of the Lighthouse pass overhead about once a minute or so. It's a very slow moving, pulsing rhythm. Now ships of varying sizes sit across the dock spread, tied to their various posts, all seemingly lightless and lifeless in their slumber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=1h26m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h26m54s">There's no one doing any sort of evening work on these ships at this hour. You see a handful of zhelezo patrolling up and down the sides of the dock doing their rounds, no urgency or direction necessarily.

Watching as the zhelezo will pass and then use that moment to dart across the street and wait for the next zhelezo to pass and then make their way over to the edge of the wharf. You see them now ducking near a stack of empty shipping crates and they wait, every now and then glancing over when a zhelezo's not nearby or looking towards one of the darkened ships that is anchored towards one of the dock extensions, not that far from one of the docking cranes that's left still after an evening of offloading from one of the other ships. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=1h28m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Steps towards it and holds the torch up and begins a soft call out. "Hello?" The shaded figure stands up and approaches, hands open, smiling. Getting a better look, you do see finer elven features, a lighter, ashy hair that's short on the sides and flopped in the front who approaches, talks briefly. You can't really hear what they're saying, it's hushed, but puts something into the hands of the zhelezo. The zhelezo takes a moment, nods and then turns around and leaves his post. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=39TP4YZHf3M&t=1h29m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
