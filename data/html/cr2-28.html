<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episodes of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m6s">We have returning this week our fantastic guests, Ashly Burch and Sumalee Montano. They've been amazing, we're excited to have them back, and going to see what this next adventure of the story's going to have. Before we get to that, we have some announcements to get through, beginning with our fantastic sponsor and friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Sam? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h0m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m25s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m25s">D&amp;D Beyond, everybody, two new products have been announced on D&amp;D Beyond. The Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, alternate title is That's So Ravnica, available for preorder now on the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace, officially will be released on November 9th. Also, The Wayfarer's Guide to Eberron, alternate title, The Werfernder's Gerd to Erberron, available for purchase now on the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace. As a reminder, anyone who already has purchased the Legendary bundle can pre-order or purchase these and any future content at a 15% discount, everyone. Which has the savings baked right in. I've been using D&amp;D Beyond for a while now, and they just redid their layout, took me a while to get used to it. For those of you at home using D&amp;D Beyond, I have a couple of tips, pointers, for the new layout, to remind myself where things are layed out. It's like little mnemonics. It's a weird thing. On the right side of the screen, you can remember "L E F," so right sort of like, LEF, left, sort of. That's where loot, equipment and features are. On the left, is "I A A," insight and awareness. I'll put that down here. Then in the middle, is "A T R," which is things you can add to roll. ATR. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h0m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m0s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m0s">I have a mounting sense of dread. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h2m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m3s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m3s">Right up top is "M S T," which is makes saving throws. That's what you add to make saving throws. That's Sam's little guide to how you can remember the layout of D&amp;D Beyond. And that's it! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h2m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m30s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m30s">Thank you, Sam! I hope that was as useful to you folks as it will never be to any of us. Thank you to D&amp;D Beyond for being our awesome sponsor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h2m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m30s">Onto the next bit of business. For those who haven't seen the announcement we had today, we are headed to London MCM Comic Expo in October, actually. October 27th and 28th, Critical Role will be in London! Super excited about that. We're looking forward to meeting a lot of you European Critters out there. We've been trying to get an opportunity to go over there for a while, so glad we finally have the chance to come and hang out with you folks across the pond. You can go to critrole.com for details on it, and we look forward to seeing you then. Also, as a reminder for next week, we will not be broadcasting an episode next Thursday. Instead, we'll be doing a live broadcast Friday evening from Indianapolis. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h2m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m30s">It will be airing, this is Friday, August 3rd, at 9:00pm Eastern time, that's 6:00pm Pacific. So it'll be an hour earlier than what you are used to, but it'll be our live show at the Murat Theater in Indianapolis. Super excited about that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h2m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m30s">It's going to be crazy. It's going to be absolutely nuts. Other than that as well, we have up on our YouTube channel now the VOD of our Vox Machina character buildout for Pillars of Eternity <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h2m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m41s">#</a> <strong>II</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m41s">Deadfire. I went ahead and messed around on stream for about an hour or so earlier this week to show you guys my interpretation of building our first campaign characters, Vox Machina, in Pillars <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h3m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m51s">#</a> <strong>EII</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m51s">Deadfire, and if you want to check it out, it's on the YouTube. That's youtube.com/criticalrole, and you get to watch me make each character, and we hang out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h3m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m4s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m5s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m6s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m6s">It was pretty good, and I might watch it again so I can actually build those characters. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h4m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m9s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m9s">I think you should, that surprised me. I've never really done a live stream of just myself playing a video game before, so that was very new experience for me. Thank you for your patience. Go check it out if you want to. Be sure to check out the Beast of Winter DLC for Deadfire is coming out soon. You can pick up the game at versesevil.com/criticalrole, and it's a fun one, so check it out if you haven't yet. Reminder that we do our Wyrmwood giveaways during the breaks, and they're going to be happening over here at the Critical Role Twitch chat, so I'll prompt you when we come to our mid break today, but we need you to come over to the Critical Role chat to enter the giveaway, and then head on back to Geek &amp; Sundry, or wherever else you're watching. That'll be at twitch.tv/criticalrole. Talks Machina, our after show discussion about what happens this week will be happening next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here on the Geek &amp; Sundry Twitch and Alpha, where our fantastic host Brian W. Foster interviews us, and makes us feel a little better about ourselves after the chaos the previous week had. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h4m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h7m30s">Welcome back, everyone. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein, who had acquired two new allies in Keg, the dwarven fighter, and Nila, the firbolg druid, had made their way to the city of Shadycreek Run. After making your way through the town, spending an evening staying at the Landlocked Lady, and getting some information about where to find info about your quarry, and where your friends may have been taken to after they were captured by the Iron Shepherds, a traveling slavers crew. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h7m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h8m6s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m6s">They're the worst. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h8m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h8m8s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m8s">They are the worst. You went and had a discussion at the Estate Sybaritic with Ophelia Mardun, of whom you were sent by The Gentleman to interface with and do a deed for her a little over two weeks ago. There it seemed that the intent of your job placed here in this city has aligned with your current goal of freeing your friends and seeking vengeance against the Iron Shepherds, as they currently work for a competitive family to the Mardun house, and in response to them destroying parts of the trade route that the Mardun family enjoys through the center and southern sides of the empire, they wish you to instill damage upon their traders as well, by eliminating the Iron Shepherds. You were given some ideas as to where you might find some help, you gathered your things, made your way north into the seemingly corrupted and haunted Savalierwood, to seek information about these Iron Shepherds and where they are. You narrowly avoided two large, immensely mutated, bone-spurred bear creatures. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h8m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m8s">You sought out and cased the exterior of the Sour Nest, which is the fortress that was given to the Iron Shepherds by the family that pays them and keeps them in their employ. You decided to send your new druid friend, Nila, in the form of a small mouse, over the wall, delivery via owl. She snuck through some portions of the fortress to gather intel, and to get an idea of where you were going and what may reside within. A few close calls, and some discovery of what can be expected within the interior, you made your way back, safely, to join your friends. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h8m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m9s">I forgot about the baby. (sigh) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h10m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m12s">Oh yeah. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h10m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h10m17s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m17s">Sorry. That just occurred to me. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h10m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h10m22s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m22s">Upon accidentally spooking one of the outer guards who were walking the perimeter of the wall that surrounds the Sour Nest, you immediately picked up what you had, fled south, back through the Savalierwood, on your way to Shadycreek Run to look for means of possibly finding more help for this endeavor when nightfall hits, and whatever else you can do to prepare for the necessary evacuation of your allies. And that's where we left off. Mighty Nein, as you've charged back through the purplish-gray corrupted Savalierwood, the midday sun barely visible through slight peaking cracks through the canopy above you, leaping and hearing these large growling sounds and hoots, you beeline it as best you can, and as quickly as you can, before you breach into the outskirts of the northern side of the North Clover area. You're now between some of the nearby buildings, and you immediately begin to see some of the relatively shady denizens of this north side of Shadycreek Run that glance over their shoulder, their hooded selves watching you as you pass. You slow your gait, as you are no longer fleeing, per se, but you have made your way back to the town. What would you like to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h10m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h11m39s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h12m3s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m3s">We mentioned about going and looking to see if a Tasker would be up to it. There were the Taskers, and there were the other group of hired workers. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h12m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m16s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m16s">Yes, The Grunge Gang-- The Grudge Gang, which the Taskers are a part of it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h12m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m21s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m21s">Wait, is is Grudge or Grunge? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h12m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m22s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h12m23s">Can I just say Grunge is better name? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h12m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m26s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m26s">Is it like, the Grudge Gang is an umbrella corporation of the Taskers, or vice versa? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h12m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m36s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m36s">Vice versa. The Grudge Gang is the overarching, loose network of mercenaries that sell swords and do not affiliate directly with any of the other political powers. They're all just outside of the system within the town. The Taskers are a small subsect of the Grudge Gang that have taken it upon themselves to keep the peace to a certain extent. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h12m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h12m58s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m58s">Do we get a sense of the Taskers, are they just a group, like us? Like a small group, or we don't know yet? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h12m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h13m6s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h13m6s">Well, you don't know. You've had some experience here. The Taskers, best that you can surmise, you haven't had a lot of dealings with them, they are probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 people. They are not a massive group by any means, and they're stretched a little thin, but because a lot of them have friends within the Grudge Gang, and people they've worked with before, they can usually call upon friends if need be, especially if they have some coin to their side and they have a specific endeavor they need to do. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h13m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h36m22s">You manage to make your way to an area where the color notably changes ahead of you. The somewhat still purple-gray color that suffuses most of the natural landscape within the Savalierwood, gives way to a patch of green in the distance. This is the first sign that calls forth that warm sensation you got when you had checked this path within your smell bag. As the rest of you begin to gather up behind Nila, the closer you get you begin to watch as these winter trees, that comprise most of this northern forest, give way to green oaks and swamp-based plant life. The temperature, as you get to a certain threshold, begins to be not quite as biting cold, slightly warmer with each step. Looking around immediately, the first thing that catches your eye is this large wall of tangled vine and thorns. The same purplish-gray color. The green is still ahead of you.

As you get a little bit closer, you can see areas where these tangle of vines are pulled apart or have entirely enclosed, and you see long-rusted, wrought iron bars, a fence of some kind. A boundary that was placed long ago, that has since been slowly taken back by nature. You then begin to see that area of the wall that you had noticed, Nott, that had seemed to be bending, and the vines have actually curled over and bent it downward. It seems that whatever this little section of the forest is-- whatever protective magics that once contained this outer vicinity have begun to give in to the corruption of the Savalierwood. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h38m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h39m45s">Frumpkin darts up, jumping from tree edge to tree edge, gliding through. There are numerous layers of similar walls. Three different layers, looks like. Whereas the outskirts or the perimeter of this beautiful, protected, ancient gravesite that once held this corruption at bay has slowly collapsed inward, and a new boundary is placed. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h39m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h39m45s">Then that boundary has fallen. As the corruption pulls in further, a new boundary is built. That third boundary now seems to be in the process of giving in, just like its previous constructs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h39m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h39m45s">Within this third area, you can see not just a lack of snow, or ice, or the winter chill, but a nearly humid summer warmth, something more akin to the southern tip of the Empire or even Menagerie Coast. It is an unexpected and extreme shift in temperature and weather. There is something unnatural, or at least magical, that maintains this little pocket of untouched paradise. There you can see small pools, bits of bog where the soft green and browns of compost fall into green, thick, algae-covered bits of water. You can see dozens and dozens of stone tablets, about a foot to two feet high, with bits of script across them, too far to see, that have partially fallen or leaning. At which point Frumpkin looks around and this entire area, from the outer very edge where that first perimeter wall was found, to the inside has all been graves, most taken back by the Savalierwood as it slowly crushes whatever this location is at its source. On the far end, towards the core and the back-- the northern side of this final, defending pocket of uncorrupted forest-- you can see a stone building, maybe 20 by 30 feet, built as an old stone steeple. It stands windowless, open, and the floor of it to each open window overgrown with green vine and leaf. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=0h39m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h14m17s">23, okay. You take a moment and there are two specific locks that are chained; one on each side that are closed. The one that's nearest to you, easy enough. The one on the opposite side, you have to pull out one of your metallic hooks that slips through a space in the wood and manage to pull it up on the side a little bit. You're essentially reverse-picking it with two hooked picks from the opposite side. It takes you a little longer, until eventually it hangs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=2h14m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There are a few spaces that are currently empty where tools probably would normally hang, and there is another door that leads to a chamber beyond, and that's where you hear the whimpering coming from. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jDCU8IRyfA&t=3h23m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Nevertheless, he reaches out and grabs the bars where you had started. "On "three: one, two, three-- (strains)."

<dd id="l3h49m6s">That puts it over 20. Both of you together (strains), and one of the bars comes off on one side. He gets in quickly and puts his shoulder in and pushes against the other, and that bends off to the side, leaving just enough room for him to push through. It takes a minute and you're helping him and grabbing his elbow, and the two of your together-- You feel something pop in his shoulder, but it's just enough to get his body to wedge out of the space, and he comes back out of it and embraces you-- the other arm limply hanging at one side, but he takes you in his hand. He looks down at his son and looks over at the rest of you, tired. Still, amongst the trauma he has suffered, there is a pride and a silent strength to him-- very much similar to that you've seen in Nila.

I undo the feather, pull it off; it's a perfectly intact red feather. I don't know who will take it, but if you ever need our help, you can come to the temple. If, by chance, we're not there-- but only because one of us would go back to check on the others of our tribe-- we'll be in the Crispvale Thicket.
