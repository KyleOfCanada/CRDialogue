<dd id="l0h0m40s">(singing) Where can I find a girl like that? Oh god. Well, what do you guys think? Taliesin did a pretty great job, right? Do you like the Crocs? Thank you. He told me a couple weeks ago, he said, "What kind of look do you want to go for?" and I said, "Do you have anything "that's a good mix between Colonel Sanders and Liberace?" I think we got there! Right before I walked out, our producer Max whispered to me, he said, "You look like a pimp from Atlantis." In all seriousness, though, I told Taliesin, I said, "Just give me the gay televangelist." Then I realized that that's a little bit redundant. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h0m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h1m56s">If you're at the con this weekend, please stop by our booth, number 2931, The Invulnerable Vagrant. Give it up for all of our crew who did a great job putting that together. It's so rad. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h1m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h2m11s">A couple quick housekeeping things before we get going, real fast. We're going to have a break, just like every episode of Critical Role, so try to stay in your seats if you can until the break and then you can go to the bathroom, get merch, whatever. If you guys were here last year, and those of you watching at home, you remember that when someone stands up, the chair sounds like someone's waterboarding a pterodactyl. If we could keep that to a minimum. What's that? Nobody cares. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h2m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m11s">Hold on. We're moving on. No, I'm just kidding. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h2m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m11s">Speaking of, during the episode tonight, you guys can laugh, scream, cheer, cry, gasp, any of that stuff. The only thing that we ask is that you don't shout any rules or corrections at Matt or the players. The only reason why we ask that, you guys, is because it's fucking annoying. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h2m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m24s">He couldn't make it. Him and Laura couldn't make it this year, but for the best reasons possible, because they just had a beautiful little baby boy, Ronin. I know. He's such a buddy! I thought maybe we could Facetime him and sing Happy Birthday. Is anybody interested in that? [cheering] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h3m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m38s">First, we have our fantastic returning sponsor, our wonderful friends at D&amp;D Beyond. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h10m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m53s">D&amp;D Beyond did not want me to sing a song, so I have one. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h10m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h10m53s">[laughter] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h10m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m0s">I'll try to get through it quick because we have so much to do. (singing) D&amp;D Beyond's our sponsor today. They got a lot of things they want me to say, like the discount code for new editions and their booth outside at intermission. But I'm sorry, I'm not saying those things, because when I'm inspired I just got to sing. I'm in a ridiculous pink frock and 2,600 Critters are ready to rock! [cheering] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h11m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m27s">(singing) At Gen Con, I'm surrounded by my friends-con, Ashly, Marisha, Matt, Taliesin-con. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h11m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m27s">They'll be by my side 'til the end-con! At Gen Con. (spoken) There's a second verse; I'll go through it fast. D&amp;D Beyond might drop us tonight, because what I'm doing here, it just ain't right. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h11m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m27s">I'm not advertising their Facebook page, or telling you the promo code GENCON2018 is what it is like I promised backstage. But this little stud's got to follow his heart. And maybe some other body parts. So if they'd want to know who to blame, why don't you just tell them by shouting my name? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h11m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h12m36s">But seriously, they are giving away a Legendary Bundle on their Facebook page, and they're offering up a special discount code, GENCON2018, for 25% off any digital products. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h12m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h12m48s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m48s">Thank you, Sam. And thank you, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Few other quick announcements to get through. My fireside chat that was part of our fantastic 826LA charity run we did a couple months back will be this coming Tuesday, August 7th, at 5:00pm Pacific, where I'll be answering a bunch of your questions and generally hanging out with the community for about an hour or more. So hope to have you there. We'll have Marisha's Honey Heist 2: Electric Beargaloo-- [cheering] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h12m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m19s">Will be this coming Friday after this, August 10th, at 7:00pm Pacific. You can watch both of these streams at twitch.tv/criticalrole and if you miss the livestream, they'll be available on our YouTube a few days after the stream, so look for that. For more details and a link to the NPC survey-- a lot of the people in the community have been helping us forge this community-made NPC that will end up becoming part of the world that we run-- go to critrole.com. Another huge announcement that has taken a lot of blood, sweat, and tears from this wonderful man, Taliesin, here, and this wonderful man, Liam O'Brien, over here. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h13m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m19s">We're excited to announce our coming sequel to our art book, The Chronicles of Exandria. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h13m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h14m30s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h14m30s">(as Caleb) Well, if you were wondering why Taliesin was losing his-- (as Liam) Oh, I'm doing Caleb already. Taliesin was losing his mind the last several weeks while also dying. I quietly lost my mind at nights out in the National Parks, it's because we've been working on this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h14m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h14m48s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h14m48s">That was the one thing I couldn't say on Talks was my first thought when Molly died was: I just lost three days off of my artbook schedule, oh god! Oh no! Please no! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h14m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h14m58s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h14m58s">It's shaping up beautifully, it's full of beautiful pieces from the community that you are probably familiar with. There's some that are new to the book, and we're very proud of-- oh, it's gone-- the cover, which is done by comic artist Matteo Scalera. You might know him from the comic Black Science. I've loved his art for a while. The cover's gorgeous. Moreno Dinisio, who does his coloring on Black Science, did it for the cover as well. The book looks amazing, and, for the thousandth time, thank you for every artist in this community who gives back to the show. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h14m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As a reminder, we have our Wyrmwood giveaways that we do during the breaks here for the Critical Role intermission. We'll be having one here tonight as well. So when we go to break, you'll have to jump over to the Critical Role Twitch chat, that's twitch.tv/criticalrole, we'll have a code at the time for you to enter, but be prepared for when that comes around. Let's see, I think that brings us mostly to the end of our announcements for the evening. It's time to get comfortable. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h15m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h18m56s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h18m56s">Welcome back. Last we had left off-- let's see if I can get some music here situated. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h18m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h18m56s">Perfect. The Mighty Nein, an intrepid band of adventurers here in the continent of Wildemount, had found three of their members taken in the middle of the night by a band of kidnappers and slavers they found to be called The Iron Shepherds. In trying to hunt down and find where their allies were taken, they ran into a previous member of this team, known as Keg, a dwarven warrior who herself was on a path to vengeance against these people she previously worked with. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h18m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h18m56s">Aligning forces, they made their way northward, towards the city of Shadycreek Run, which exists outside of the laws and boundaries of the Dwendalian Empire. Along the way, they ambushed The Iron Shepherds, and in doing so lost one of their allies. With Mollymauk fallen on the battlefield and the rest left to simmer over the decisions they made, they continued northward, where they encountered a new friend, north of the city of Shadycreek Run. Caduceus Clay was pulled from his hermit lifestyle north of the city within the confines of the Savalierwood to join them in assaulting The Sour Nest, the keep where the Iron Shepherds call home. They staked out the outskirts of this location, managed to slay some of the guardians who were keeping watch along the outer perimeter wall, not necessarily very stealthily made their way into the entryway, but managed to take out a number of members of the Iron Shepherds, some of their paid compatriots, as well as some of their more elite, at least one of their more elite, fighters. Along with them they had met Nila, who is a firbolg who was searching for her also kidnapped partner and son. Using her druidic powers, aided them in this assault, and in doing so found and helped her family escape. As she absconded from the location with her family to keep them safe, the rest of you remained behind, trying to find out where the remainder of The Iron Shepherds reside within The Sour Nest and how best to deal with their presence. Last we left off, Caleb, you had sent Frumpkin, your familiar, in the form of a spider, to inspect the upper floor of the chamber, and upon feeling a squeeze from Keg, had just instilled her with the speed and alacrity of a Haste spell. And that's where we're going to pick up. In this moment, Keg, as you go to notify Caleb of what has transpired below, he reaches out and instills you with that familiar surge of adrenaline. Time seems to slow, your muscles tense and flex. What do you do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=0h18m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You see heavy chains dangling at the front and the back of it, as this is probably a location where individuals are strapped to and tortured. Two sets of prison barred doors flank the opposite ends that seem to have larger containment chambers beyond there. They look to be heavy and very locked and barred.

As both of your weapons and fists swing upward, they hit what feels like rock and scatter it like ash against both sides of the walls. The torso falls and tumbles to the ground, one arm still dragging Lorenzo towards the stairs in this last minute bit of desperation before it tumbles onto its back, the flame curling and burning away the rest of his face and jaw. The hand left there limp before that, eventually, is taken too, leaving nothing but charred charcoal behind. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=L3vV7ZdE_w8&t=3h38m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
