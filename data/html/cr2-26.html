<dd id="l0h0m31s">Before we jump into tonight's game, let's get through our announcements. First and foremost, our fantastic sponsor for this evening, and has been for quite some time, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h0m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m45s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m45s">D&amp;D Beyond! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h0m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m47s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m47s">Sam, if you want to take that away. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h0m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m49s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m49s">Yes, D&amp;D Beyond wanted to announce that their 826LA donation campaign has officially come to an end, and they've raised $11,400 for 826LA based on 114 natural ones rolled through the end of June. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h0m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m49s">We are terrible, but our bad luck is the kids' good fortune. The main thing that people have been wondering and talking about on The Facebooks and stuff is the new baby. Travis and Laura aren't here, you guys might have noticed, and everyone's like, "How was the birth? How did it all go down "two Thursdays ago?" So I have taken a little license, but I have scripted a bit of a radio play that we're all going to participate in to show our viewers how it all went down two Thursdays ago, and how the birth came to be. Taliesin will be narrating, I will be playing the role of Travis, Marisha will be playing the role of Laura. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h0m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m49s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

A couple of quick notes here: we are headed to San Diego Comic-Con next week for our Critical Role panel and, as we announced today, we're also going to New York Comic-Con later this year. For details on either of those events, go to Critrole.com for all the information. It's there for you. The "Nott the Best Detective Agency" shirt is up in the store right now. Once again, head to shop.critrole.com to check it out. Our fantastic, terrible detectives. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h5m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h6m14s">We'll see. Yeah. Starting this week, the Wyrmwood giveaways are back for Critical Role intermission. The giveaways will be hosted on the Critical Role Twitch channel, however, and moving forward, so when we're coming to the break, if you want to jump over to the Critical Role Twitch, it's Twitch.tv/criticalrole. There, you can enter the Wyrmwood giveaways. Keep an eye out for that and we'll remind you before we jump to the break as well. You can watch our hosted stream and our sweepstakes there, at that location. As a reminder, Talks Machina, our after-discussion show about whatever transpires here at this table, is every Tuesday evening. The next episode will be next Tuesday at 7:00 PM Pacific time, hosted by our fantastic Brian W. Foster, if he can get away from Lancaster long enough. He'll be giving out prizes for Gif of the Week, for Fanart of the Week, and all that fun stuff, so check it out on Tuesday. Other than that, let's go ahead and jump in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h8m47s">So. Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty Nein were making their way north after making a deal with the Gentleman in Zadash. They had completed the first of two tasks for him, the second one requiring them to make their way to the northern city of Shadycreek Run, outside of the Empire, to meet with a business operative of his, who had been busy with some other elements and needed some help to reconnect about what their business together was. Along this journey, you had made a stop in the gnomish city of Hupperdook, where you discovered the work-hard-play-hard gnomish society, got all your money taken from you, got it returned to you as you found out the thieves were the young children of a family, the parents of which had been arrested and had been imprisoned for a while. You went to the prison, helped destroy one of their long-haywire guardians, and paid off the rest of the fine for those parents, to set them free, returning them to their children, and decided to leave your temporary companion for a while, Kiri, with them, as a safer means of continuing her journey, now with her new family. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h8m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m47s">With that, you gathered your things, found yourself a better crossbow, and began heading back on the trail along the Crispvale Road and making your way northward. There, you had set up camp for the evening about a day's travel outside of Hupperdook, and during the night, while Yasha and Fjord were taking their watch, wakening Jester with their conversation, and the three of them deciding to step away from the camp as not to wake the rest of you, they were... Well, they went missing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h8m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m34s">We begin today's story as morning slowly creeps over the distant mountains.

<dd id="l0h17m57s">All right. You guys rush over, and there you can see on the ground this patch of disturbed grass that has been pushed down, along with the dirt that has been jammed and shoved up into small side piles and trenches that were dug in. There's definitely signs of a struggle here. At a quick glance, looking around, footprints and signs, there looks to be somewhere between five to eight sets of footprints you can see from all different angles. And you can see three grooves being dragged through the dirt into the grass, towards the road a little bit northward. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h17m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h18m35s">Yeah. You guys go ahead and follow these the best you can, eventually making your way to the outer side of the Crispvale Road, the path that you were on already, but a little ways north of where you were. And there you can see the grooves end, and a number of sets of heavy wagon wheels begin, or at least have previously pulled off the trail and then pushed themselves back onto the road. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h18m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h19m49s">You're not entirely certain. The tracks seem to be traveling either in the northeast direction that the road goes that you were traveling, or heading back towards Hupperdook. What you do notice, though, and what keys you in that this has something to do with this, is the tracks grind off the road by about five or ten feet, and that's where the grooves of these dragged individuals or sacks stop. And then it pushes back onto the road. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h19m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Behind that, you see two figures a little bit beyond your sight to make out all the details, but one seems to be a tall humanoid, the other seems to be much shorter and smaller, probably halfling, gnome. And then off in the bushes, not hiding very well, you see another figure, keeping low to your left. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h25m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h45m29s">You guys are currently right... here. So you just left Hupperdook, you're on the Crispvale Roadway making your way to the Crispvale Thicket which is the large forest at the crossroads. You can travel about 24 miles per an eight hour day at a normal pace with the horses and cart, you can go 30 miles at a fast pace, and you can force a march to go for another hour, or two, or three afterward but you start making constitution saving throws or take exhaustion points at that point. But you can get quite a good distance depending on how fast you're going. The cart keeps you at a slower pace. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h45m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h52m4s">All right, as you're heading down into the center part of the northern side of the Marrow Valley. Keeping a look ahead, you can see just as you crest over this one little embankment, the Crispvale Thicket ahead of you. This beautiful cluster of dark-green trees. The clouds have completely taken the sky back and it's this low, gloomy gray as the air gets chilly, as the day progresses onward getting closer and closer to dusk. You manage to get to the outskirts of the thicket itself. You see the trees growing thicker and the actual canopy of dark green pine trees starting to gather. You now have the opportunity, if you want to, you can travel into the crossroads and head north, or you can skirt around the forest off the path. Those are your-- because you haven't-- you're basically having to go to the center and then back north, but you're on the road the whole time. Or if you wanted to skip past it, you'll travel a little slower-- basically a similar pace. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h52m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h59m12s">A lot of the furniture looks damaged, some of it looks burned weirdly. As you, looking around on the inside, you're rummaging around for any possible books or anything that can be useful. You don't find any books, you do manage to find a bundle of unused torches, five. You have a handaxe that's a little old and rusted, but it's still functional. It's well made. That was left under one of the shelves that had fallen over. And you find a mostly filled oil lantern. While the glass of the actual lantern is broken, it still is pretty filled with oil. So if you wanted to-- if you had a container, you could fill it and have a flask of oil. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=0h59m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h52m35s">There are some changes and such so reminding you guys that moving forward we'll be doing the Wyrmwood giveaway at the Critical Role Twitch chat. So you need to head to twitch.tv/criticalrole for the break to enter. If you're watching on Alpha or Geek &amp; Sundry just switch over and you can head on back over when you're done. Right now, the offer, once again, only stands for people in the US and Canada excluding Quebec because of weird giveaway rules and laws. However, tonight's prize is a Wyrmwood cherry dice tower with this fantastic cartography burned in of maps designed by our fantastic Deven Rue, who you may recognize, who's done the map of the Dwendalian Empire that we have here as well as other amazing bits and also designed the compass rose on our map. She's amazing. Her work's amazing and while this isn't available with Wyrmwood yet, keep an eye out because cool stuff like this might be showing up more often. So this will be given away to some lucky person in the break. Need to go into the Critical Role Twitch chat and enter only one time. Enter the key phrase "Kegstand." So enter it once. Magnets, it's magic. So enter it once; more than once, you'll be disqualified and we'll announce the winner here at the end of the break so we'll see you here in a few minutes. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=1h52m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h55m3s">That's better. Frumpkin slowly comes upon the warmth of this distant fire, closer and closer until coming around the corner, seeing a small fire heating a cauldron of some kind, some metal bowl. A bit of steam is rising off of whatever liquid is in the interior. You see an elderly woman in darker, tattered clothing that drapes off of the body, hunched but tall, very tall, like six and a half feet tall at a hunch. Make a perception check for Frumpkin, please, at this distance with disadvantage. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=1h55m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h56m16s">The skin of this woman is a faint gray color, almost a gray-blue tint. The hair is this matted mess of tangled white and gray that is pulled back and tied behind the head where it cascades over the shoulders. The ears are long and pointed, out to the sides a bit. The nose is wide and pressed up into the face. She is going back and forth from this little hovel that's on the opposite side, that's built between two trees: a large thick one and another that seems to have fallen and come to rest at an angle next to it. In that small cranny between the two trees, you can see this little hut built of thatch and sticks and rope to construct this little home. It's almost like an arch that's holding it up. Near the ground of this cauldron, you see a child of some kind that is sitting on the ground, holding knees to its chest. It looks to be a boy. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=NZVqPja6Alg&t=1h56m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

One hand is still up, but it seems that she's pulled back a bit from the aggressive stance she was previously in. As she lifts her face a bit, you can see a bit more of her expression in the light as the hair pulls away as she lifts her chin. You can see that the face is humanoid, but with a wider nose. The skin is grayish, almost a blue tint, with bits of a soft fur. It takes you a second to recognize where you've seen these features before.

<dd id="l2h46m54s">There's a mild break in the clouds on the eastern horizon over the Ashkeeper and the Dunrock Mountains. You're still getting a mostly cloudy sky, but there are occasional bits of morning light, faint light blues and yellows, and soft white. The snowfall that has come throughout the evening and packed up the very chilly cold night is beginning to faintly thaw, but it is still a very cold morning. As you all begin to come to consciousness and gather your things, the clouds close once more, and you look off towards the northeast side of the valley and you can see another darkened cloud coming with more snow and a less forgiving turn of weather. Although it's a ways off, you can see it this far away. You pick up your things, horses at the ready. Do you continue your journey?
