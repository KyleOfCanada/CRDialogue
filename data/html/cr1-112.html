<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Before we go ahead and jump into tonight's story, we have some announcements to get through. First and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by our fantastic friends at Marvel Puzzle Quest. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">(cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m17s">Indeed. Returning to be awesome fans of the show and friends and Sam do you have anything to say about that? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h0m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m25s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m25s">We love Marvel Puzzle Quest and they love that we love them. In fact, Puzzle Quest had a bunch of critters come up to their booth at Gen-con to say hi, and they wanted to thank the community for being so awesome and welcoming. The game is legitimately awesome. It is so awesome, it is so epic that me talking about it doesn't do justice. Really it needs another artform. One that is an amazing theatrical experience and expression of joy and emotion. It needs opera. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h0m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m59s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m0s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m0s">So combining Puccini and Marvel Puzzle Quest, I give you an operadvertisement. Shit, that music. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h1m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m18s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m18s">No, it's okay. This is going to be terrible anyway. (singing) The new SHIELD clearance level nine lands today, bro. Better rewards and challenges you can recruit Lockjaw the inhuman doggo. For more chances to summon Black Bolt, other Inhumans, and Kamala Khan, and boost the power of your superhero squad. Last but not least, for a limited time you can also recruit the Silver Surfer and Thanos and Star-Lord and the cosmic legends pack. (speaking) Oh shit, I forgot my props. (singing) From now until the 30th of September. Marvel Puzzle Quest. Marvel Puzzle Quest! (cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h1m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m8s">Olivia Samson's art captures the mood and the feel so well. Chris Northrop's color and his lettering. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h4m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m8s">Everyone did an amazing job on this. If you have an opportunity to check it out, it's available on the Dark Horse Comics app, through our friends at Dark Horse or ComiXology and other avenues from there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h4m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m47s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m47s">Also, all the updates are on Geek and Sundry right? Don't tweet the same question 30 times to every member of the cast. Don't do that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h4m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m47s">Just look it up on Geek and Sundry. You're going to get a quicker answer, though, if you look it up on Geek and Sundry. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h4m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m19s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m19s">Fantastic. It is Subtember on Twitch. If you haven't had enough cash to throw towards subbing to your favorite Twitch channel, for the month of September, you get half off for doing so. If you're interested in doing that, this is the month to do it. Go look into it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h6m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m19s">Last but not least, as many of you are aware in this string of natural disasters that keeps hitting, there was a terrible earthquake that hit Mexico City and the surrounding areas this past week. We want to implore people to do whatever you can to donate and help those who are currently recovering in the relief effort in the areas that were heavily hit by this earthquake. Having lived through a number of earthquakes in my youth, it's a very scary and very dangerous thing, and nothing on the scale of what they're undergoing there, so if you have the opportunity, we want to promote UNICEF and Oxfam México. The links will be in the chat soon, but if you can, please give. It all helps and people who are in the middle of that scenario will be very thankful. Thank you very much. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h6m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m19s">All right, on that note, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h6m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m19s">[dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h6m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m54s">Hello, and welcome back. You guys can discuss this in a minute. Last we left off, Vox Machina had been climbing their way through the bowels of an undead risen primordial titan, previously having found information about the history of Vecna from the Knowing Mistress regarding his ascension, the avatar form, and the drive he needs to create a miracle before he can truly embody and begin to grow the power to really exemplify the abilities of the god that he has now become. You began to make your way through the interior where you battled corrupted earth elementals that existed in him naturally. You began to battle undead skeletons and undead trolls. Eventually, after making your way towards a series of key-trapped rooms, one of which seemed to be some sort of mirrored incinerator, you made your way towards an upward tunnel and encountered a number of disciples, cultists of the Undying King, Vecna. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h8m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m54s">In this confrontation, you encountered face-to-face a Sphere of Annihilation, and through some clever uses of short-range teleportation and losing one's face, you managed to stop them before, one, they destroyed your party, or managed to escape to alert others of your presence, and last we left off, you all were resting within that hallway, thinking about what the next course of action is. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h8m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m54s">So, Vox Machina, what would you like to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h8m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h14m28s">Okay. You continue up the staircase, the steps being wider than the previous ones you've seen before. Eventually, you pass through the carved tunnel of a cave-in up the steps. The next chamber reveals itself naught but 25 feet upwards. It opens up. You find yourselves standing within a small building ruin, but the walls have fallen around you. You can see the bare structure around you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m28s">Elements of the base floor, rubble and broken slate. You see around you what must have been a once-colossal courtyard or a commons for the dwarven city of Thomara, with varying levels and paths and platforms holding rare types of now petrified leafless trees scattered amongst this thoroughfare, climbing up dozens of feet like frozen bolts of lightning forever reaching in vain. You see dead-littered paths, weaving between stout multi-leveled buildings of Thomara make, corpses that have been torn apart and are twitching, shifting on their own, the occasional hand pulling its way across. Whatever bits and pieces of undead here remain, they are not functional. They have been so sundered through the ages or other sort of confrontation, and yet are cursed to forever twitch and wander. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m28s">Your eyes, as they focus in on this interior, you glance to the opposite side. You see the ghost of this past beauty of the city surrounding you is now currently defiled on a mass scale. Over half of this 300-foot-wide cavern appears to have collapsed or is currently crushed under an invading mass of black earth and rock, unlike the rest of the titan's interior. The familiar smell of wet earth and ancient decay is now mixed with another familiar scent of cold ash and iron dust, the smell of the Shadowfell. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m28s">At this distance, you can see the rough shape of three carved archways at the base of this inverted mass of earth that curves down and collapses half of this cavern. About 40 or so feet apart. You can see at each of these entrances, there are some figures, some shapes. They are too far from you at the moment, hundreds of feet away from you, to make any sort of clear vision, but you see a few bits of torchlight in the distance and shifting shadows near those entrances. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h14m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

He nudges the other figure, which you can see is a female half-orc who looks heavily scarred across the chin and the side of the neck, and they're both missing the corresponding eye. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h53m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Now you have the heavy footfalls of the large, looming rot behemoth in the center walkway and a handful of skeletons for that approach, blockading that, as the knight, with the two other hooded figures, begin to make their way towards the entrance where you guys rose up. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=0h53m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It seems to be just enough to distract. They continue walking forward. You hear the hum of the orb as it slowly makes its way past you, faint hint of a Doppler.

<dd id="l1h23m31s">You peek up past the edge. The sky above you glows a sickly teal color as the darkened storm above is obscured by the crackle of the arcane barrier that encases the city. Glancing at the size of the barrier and the points of origin, you can see that only the inner portion of Thar Amphala is here. The inner wall and everything within. The outer regions were left in the Shadowfell when it was transported. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=1h23m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h23m31s">Peppered shifting shapes of winged, black clusters of creatures scan the sky above. Dozens and dozens of gloomstalkers seeking any sight of intruders across the enclosed atmosphere of this arcane dome. In the distance, you can see the terrible spire of Entropis standing once more. A web-like network of greenish energy fork like veins across the exterior to hold the structure firm. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=1h23m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h23m31s">A muffled boom is heard. You glance up, and see from the outside of this dome an explosion burst across the magical barrier. Harmless, then dissipates. Squinting hard, you can make out obscured shapes of wyvern riders. Swarming and circling the outside of the barrier. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=1h23m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

They're not being stationary and they're constantly circling through. As you glance up and look and nudge away, you can see their yellow eyes piercing from their black, lightless form. Their wings, as they expand and shift, you can see that faint glance, the beams of their vision, scanning across the rooftops.

<dd id="l1h53m8s">They've all been moved topside. You see, glancing through the bits of street that you have in visual range, maybe 35 to 40 dwarven undead that are wandering through open spaces, mixing with the various soldiers from battles long past, when Thar Amphala still existed in the Shadowfell. You've encountered those undead already. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=1h53m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h53m8s">You also glance around past the gloomstalkers as you're keeping an eye. As you're scanning through the crowds, you see something different: larger, flying through the skies on the opposite end of the dome. It appears winged, with a tail, but porous, like a tattered sail or a ladder.

As you rush into the room, you all dart into the nearby doorway. There's a half-ajar door that's broken, and you push through, being careful not to slam into it or to break it and cause any noise, but you all rush into this chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kTd4D8q5MvY&t=2h20m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>

About a hundred feet. 150 feet. And then as you head down to that point, you suddenly emerge and you can see a small cavern, maybe ten feet in diameter. Looks like there's a bit of rubble.

<dd id="l2h42m46s">Okay. It then takes you at a slight angle down into the liquid, and now you can see the tunnel continues downward.
