<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role! We've had a two-week hiatus due to illness and traveling, but we're back, and we're a little late today because of traffic in Los Angeles, which is always a pleasurable experience. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m15s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m15s">This is what happens when you get half the cast in a session together. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h0m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m18s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m19s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m19s">It was good times! We love you, Steve! You did great! But no, so, we're happy to be here, we missed you guys, we missed each other, and the rest of our team just arrived as well. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h0m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m31s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m31s">We've got a Sam, and we've got a Liam coming in right now. So, let's go ahead and knock these announcements out so we can get this game started. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h0m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m31s">So, first and foremost, I want to let you guys know that Tor Books has been nice enough to help sponsor tonight's episode of content, so you guys have seen announcements and stuff for their new book, Bands of Mourning, which we had at the last game, you being a Brandon Sanderson fan for a long time. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h0m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m55s">#</a> <strong>WILL</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m55s">Huge Brandon Sanderson Fan. We've talked about this. Yeah, we've talked about this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h0m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m0s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m0s">So it's good, good stuff. I've been perpetually prodded about whether or not that's me on the cover. It's not, but if they ever option it for a film it is. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h1m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m9s">#</a> <strong>WILL</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m14s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m14s">Well, see, there we go. Read the books, then write a screenplay, then get it optioned, and then cast me. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h1m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m19s">#</a> <strong>WILL</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h1m21s">How hard could that be? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h1m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m23s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m23s">Yeah, so, Bands of Mourning. Thank you, Tor, for taking an interest in our little show, and I hope you guys take an interest in their awesome books. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h1m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m23s">So, have fun! Next up, announcements, me and Marisha want to give a big shoutout and thanks to Kaizoku Con in Ireland. We had a wonderful time meeting a bunch of you Critters over there on the green isle. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h1m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m43s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m45s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m48s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m48s">Yes, and there were a bunch of people who came over from England, as well. We had a couple people from Egypt. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h1m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m57s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m58s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m58s">It was really, really cool. So thank you guys for all coming out and visiting us. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h1m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m1s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m1s">This episode is also sponsored by Jameson. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h2m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m4s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m4s">(laughs) Because we got a lot of it when we were there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h2m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m6s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m6s">Thanks, Ireland! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h2m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m7s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m7s">Let's see, next up, I want to give a thanks to Syrinscape again. I'm going to be incorporating Syrinscape's audio programming into sessions in the near future once we get everything ironed out from my list setup, but they're an awesome program you should check out to help you run audio for your tabletop gaming experiences. It has built-in soundboards and music tracks. It's really, really cool, so I recommend you check them out. Also, I want to give a big thank-you to Dwarven Forge. We had a Critter in the past send me a bunch of dungeon tiles, and I myself had backed previous Kickstarters of theirs, and just recently got all my city builder stuff, and have more that they sent me that may be showing up on the stream in the near future, to help make battle maps and things look a lot cooler and more three dimensional, so I'm excited about that. They also have a really amazing Kickstarter that just went up last week called the castle builder, where now Dwarven Forge allows you modular pieces where you can build and customize your own castle pieces for your game at home, and it looks ridiculous! So, if that's something that interests you for your home games, go check out Dwarven Forge's Kickstarter for the castle builder. Looks pretty fricking rad. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h2m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m7s">I've already given them way too much money for it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h2m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m7s">Also, for those of you who have tried out the Order of the Lycan for my Blood Hunter build, I did an update last night. Minor tweaks. Basically, just clarifying some of the rules for dex builds, as well as some minor balance adjustments, but go check it out! Beyond that, all the feedback's been really positive. I don't foresee any major tweaks in the near future, so that's good. Marisha, you wanted to pitch your new show that's coming out here? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h2m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m55s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m55s">Yes, I have a new show coming out on Geek and Sundry. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h3m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m58s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m58s">Whoa, is that true? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h3m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m59s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m16s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m16s">Anyway, it's called Signal Boost, and there's actually going to be a never-before-seen promo airing during the intermission, but yeah, I'm hosting the first run, and I'm producing it, and Sean Becker is directing it, and it's written by Eric Campbell, so it should be very fun. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h4m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m35s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h4m41s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m41s">A hundred percent. It's sponsored by Time Warner Cable. It's great. Yeah. Check it, no it's not, that would be awful. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h4m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m51s">#</a> <strong>WILL</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m51s">It's going to be on from two to six? Or six to eight, or whenever they want to show up? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h4m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m54s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h5m4s">It's airing on Tuesday. On geekandsundry.com. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h5m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m8s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m8s">Huzzah. Laura, you have something you just got a chance to talk about recently. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h5m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m13s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m13s">Oh man, yeah! On Tuesday, I think it was Tuesday, we finally got to admit, I got to say that I was in Gears of War 4. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h5m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m13s">(cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h5m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m22s">So that's pretty exciting. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h5m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m24s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m26s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m26s">Any idea. I know, I'd already had a bunch of messages on Twitter, but I couldn't confirm them until the 8th, and I finally can. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h5m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m43s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m43s">That's confusing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h5m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m44s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m44s">I know, right? I already like him because his name is Liam, but, and I also like him because he's a nerd. And I say this because he just started a Kickstarter for a card game that he developed called Monster Lab, so if you guys want to check it out, it's really really cute, it's really really fun, I think it's been going for like 15 days. They're doing really well on the Kickstarter but now they're going for stretch goals, so. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h5m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m4s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h8m45s">Bring it in. So to catch everyone up what's going on, Vox Machina, our intrepid band of adventurers, after dealing with the horrible attacks by the dragon circle known as the Chroma Conclave, destroying cities all across Tal'Dorei, the party escaped, sent the refugees they could, as well as allies, back to Whitestone, seemingly not on the radar of this attacking front of dragons at the moment, and then made their way toward Vasselheim to find allies, Pike staying behind to help with the refugees at the moment. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h8m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m45s">Upon going to Vasselheim, you managed to encounter a number of old friends from the Slayer's Take and enlist them for the time being to help you with the refugees and your current wanderings here in the city proper. At the same time, you encountered Lady Kima, who also has agreed to help with the events in Whitestone and this entire dragon attack towards the east, and you, after wandering the city for a bit, retrieving these allies, followed Grog into the Trial Forge, where you had a conversation with Earthbreaker Groon. And by conversation I mean a full-on drag-out sandpit battle to prove your worth to him, in which case you were given information about these things called the Vestiges of the Divergence, artifacts of great legendary power that existed from previous wars that had wiped out most of society multiple times. These Vestiges have been scattered around the world, many of them lost to the history books or passed down as symbols of power through various bloodlines or government positions, or stolen and haven't been seen for hundreds of years. You've found the location of two of them, one of which was the Titanstone Knuckles, and the other happened to be some sort of a leather, a Deathwalker's Leather that belonged to a champion of the Raven Queen. This exists in apparently the champion's tomb, which used to exist to the west of Vasselheim until it eventually sunk into the ground as the topography shifted over time and resides beneath a lake known as the Marrowglade Loch. So. That is where we left off, as you guys recovered from the encounter in the Trial Forge, and deciding on your plan going forward. Stepping from the tavern, having a few drinks, and discussing the merits of your current path, what would you like to do, friends? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h8m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h22m34s">As far as lakes go, it's maybe a few hundred feet across. It's more from a part of the land mass actually having a large sinkhole and where certain things may have existed, and there are bits of ruin throughout the surroundings of some sort of a structure that existed there, but most of it seems to have been swallowed up by the ground and the lake has formed in its place, though this was quite some time ago. And it swells or drains based on how much snowfall there has been in recent seasons, and it's been a pretty heavy winter for you guys, so you imagine from the times you've seen it that it's been pretty high, if not frozen over at times. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h22m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There are many books about the history of the temples here in the town, elements of the battles of old, but they're all very vague in their writing as almost like a story as opposed to a historical fact-gathering-type presentation. You manage to find a place that does deal in dusty books, partially repaired and restored books, a little bit pricier, but there is one tome that seems to talk specifically about the history of the Raven Queen's rise here in the city, and if you would like to possibly take this book, for a price, that is up to you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h26m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The champions are just mentioned or spoken of in public as The Champion, so the name is part of the gift they give to the Raven Queen when they swear themselves to her. Fell in the final conflict and was interred within a tomb to the west of Vasselheim. It is said that it is a multi-leveled tomb, and as the Raven Queen's fellowship began to fall out of favor after the Divergence had happened-- essentially, because her realm is death, during times of great conflict and strife, there is great power and a lot of energy given towards the Raven Queen. When things fall into peace time, or at least, for an extended period of time, there isn't a lot of conflict or burgeoning death and destruction within the vicinity, her worship tends to dwindle. As that dwindled, there wasn't enough people within the remaining bloodlines to maintain the tomb. It fell into disuse and since then has not been tended to. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h33m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h51m41s">All right, so. Glancing through the murky water beneath the ice's surface, it is dark, and what little bit of light that would be hitting the surface is refracting through the ice, so it's very hard to get a form. You can see there's a very thick layer of bottom-of-the-lake undergrowth: various underwater plants that have caked the entire floor area of the lake. However, you can just see, at the edge of your vision before the rest of the light is swallowed by the water and the murkiness of the depths, you can see what looks to be the edge of some sort of stone structure, where two walls would be joined, but they break off and crumble and disappear into more of the undergrowth. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h51m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It looks almost like a slightly tilted peak of some sort of structure that comes to a point, and the top of the point is broken off and crumbled, and there are a couple of sections of stone that seem to offshoot at four different points towards the very bottom of the lake itself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=0h53m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You could empty the lake, for the most part, if you wanted to do it now, but right now you're just holding it aloft as these two water pillars. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=1h30m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you all are standing there, the light of Zahra's staff lighting the area, there's the impact of water rushing in against the stonework, and you can feel the whole place shake from the impact, and immediately water begins to rush in through the cracks of this created section. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=1h39m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h40m28s">I was going to say, based on the push of the water against the rock and Bigby's Hand against that, I need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add eight for Bigby's strength to try and hold the plug in place. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=1h40m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h40m42s">24 total roll. With that impact, you can see streams of water pushing through and mud and other elements filling the gaps of the stonework, Bigby's Hand pushing up against it. Looks like the stonework was ready to give, and the water begins to go ahead and fill this vicinity, the hand pushes back until the streams that are peeking through turn to a trickle, and by the time the spell finally comes to an end, the hand vanishes, the plugged hole gives a little bit, and then seems to keep itself in place. Water's still dribbling out and trickling, there is still a gradual bit of moisture passing through here, and you don't know how long it'll hold, but for the time being, it seems to be holding. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=1h40m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h2m15s">All right, so the two of you have light from this pitch-dark vicinity, which is helpful for those of human descent. No undead presence in the vicinity. Vax, pushing down this stairwell, it continues down with a slight curvature, almost like a gradual spiral staircase, until eventually it hits a floor area. The flooring here is at a tilt. From what you can see, this whole tomb, this whole ruin, when it sank in, it sank at a slight angle, and the surface of all the stonework here is still slick with water and various liquid that has trickled through over time. You get the sense that there are a number of leaks within this temple, and the pond that would grow larger is steadily slipping into this ruin, and then being filled over time from the rainy and snowy weather as it hits the area. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=2h2m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It ends on the opposite side with curved corners. You can see what appears to be four pillars in the room that meet the floor to the ceiling, the ceiling which is about 25 feet tall. Most of the tunnels you've passed through here are about 15 to 20: this is about 25 feet tall at its full height. But these pillars reach to the ceiling, and there are steps across the way, what appears to be a raised platform.

<dd id="l4h16m15s">All right, so. As you glance over at Scanlan and give him that visual perspective of, "Let's do this," you glance over, reach out your hand and pull Bigby's Hand towards you. It streaks up and grabs the back of the beholder like a baseball, just palming it, thrusting it down towards you, Zahra. Its mouth open, it reaches down, teeth open, momentarily frustrated by the moment, it's going to use this to try and bite down. As you reach up, you slam your staff up into its mouth and release the Witch Bolt at ground zero from the inside of its body. The eye widens for a second as the top of the staff pierces the upper part of its palate, and with a burst of black and bluish electrical energy, the entirety of its skull just (explosion), just detonates from the inside, sending chunks of slimy flesh and bone and whatever brain matter resides inside the cranium of this beholder scattering across the room. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=4h16m15s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you guys slowly start bringing Kima up, the rope itself tense with the weight, 'cause she's wearing a lot of armor, but it manages to pull her up without issue. You go ahead to the top of the sarcophagus there and it is covered in black feathers, some of which got pushed off in the battle. You shove the top open and you can see inside a skeletal corpse that is resting, surrounded by what looks like very, very fine golden and silver jewelry that have just been laid at its sides. And on the corpse itself, you can see there is a set of jet-black studded leather armor that has a series of runic engravings and carvings along pretty much every square inch of the leather. And you can see around the the mantle of it, where the leather mantle falls, the edge is trimmed with black feathers. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=4h19m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l4h38m50s">The language is a forgotten language. It has been dead for-- probably since before the Divergence. But your eyes clarify on it in the arcane nature of your sight. You pick up phrases throughout, and it is a tale of the creation of the Raven Queen. It is a tale of her ascendance from mortal to immortal. It is the history of her penance for ascending and taking the throne of another entity that was supplanted. It's just seemingly a history tale that is woven in with a very, very strong enchantment, and you see within each one of these little runic sections, there are mentions of elements: fire, ice, lightning, you know, it runs through all these various elemental arcane properties that are bound into this enchantment. You're not entirely certain what the nature of it is. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KHsA0R_GovU&t=4h38m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
