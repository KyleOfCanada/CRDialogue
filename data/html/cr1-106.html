<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Before we get into tonight's episode, we've got to get through a few announcements. First off, we have our wonderful Darin De Paul joining us again. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">(cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m16s">Thank you, Darin. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h0m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m18s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m18s">Excited to have you back. We've all recovered from a crazy Comic-Con, mostly. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h0m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m22s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m24s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m24s">I'm being optimistic here. We're recovering from a Comic-Con. Got a chance to meet a bunch of you guys out there. It was a lot of fun, but we're here to get our announcements started, so let me do that. First off, Laura, I believe there's a merch update. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h0m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m38s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m38s">Yes, there is, and I just realized I had it on and I hadn't announced it yet. So we got these back in the store! But they're red now. We've got them on this chain and on this chain rope-thing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h0m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m38s">Cord. And we've got them a keychain. And now, I don't know if you saw them before, but they took a long time to get, and now we just have them in the store. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h0m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m2s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m2s">I don't know. It depends on how many people buy them, I guess, but we're going to try to keep them in stock. That's the statement that like, okay, that happened, but this is what I'm really excited about. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h1m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m19s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m19s">(sings victory song) Is the camera on? I can't tell. It's a pencil pack. I asked them to make this, because this is so great. So we all have our own pencils. Everybody has a pencil. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h1m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m19s">We've got the "How do you want to do this?" pencil. We've got the "I would like to rage" pencil. We've got a Scanlan pencil-- oh no, this is a Tary pencil. This is a "Doty, take this down" pencil. I don't want to say all the things because they're so great, but check them out. It's in the store now. Does everybody want their pencil? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h1m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m1s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m1s">Are these #2 pencils? Could someone take the SAT with my "Doty, take this down" pencil? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h2m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m6s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h2m20s">Such a good one. Oh, this is the Pike one. And here's yours, Matt. It's pretty dope, so check them out. I'm in love. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h2m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m31s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m31s">What's great is if you use it a lot, eventually "How do you want to do this?" becomes "do you want to do this?" to "you want to do this?" to "want to do this?" to "do this?" to "this?" (laughs) It's existential the entire time you're using the pencil. I'm really excited about that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h2m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m48s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h3m6s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h4m21s">Update on the campaign guide stuff I would like to give you.

<dd id="l0h4m55s">So what's the update? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h4m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m57s">#</a> <strong>CHRIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m57s">So last week we put the campaign guide up for sale and it exceeded all of our expectations, yes. So thank you to everyone who pre-ordered. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h4m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m57s">This is by far the most successful pre-order that we've ever had for a book, so you're rocking it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h4m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m57s">It has led to an unexpected complication, though, in that our initial print run is of a size that cannot be changed right now. We had to stop taking pre-orders so we would have some to send to stores, because obviously, we value game stores and we want them to have some, so I just wanted to reassure everybody that this book is not a limited edition book. We're printing more, so if you were not able to pre-order it, you will be able to get it later. We're basically going to immediate reprint. In the interim, the PDF is still available, so you can get that if you like electronic books, or if you have a local store, they can take part in what's called our Pre-Order Plus program. It allows people to pre-order through the store and then get the $5 PDF deal that we were offering as part of the pre-order. So ask your local stores, do you take part in Pre-Order Plus? If you need a link for that, you can check our Twitter. Otherwise, second print run will be along as soon as we can get it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h4m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h11m44s">And welcome back, everybody. Last we left off, Vox Machina had been finding their way through the realms to talk with various deities in hopes of getting information, and perhaps a blessing or two, to aid them in their coming battle against Vecna, the intent-to-ascend entity, the long-missing and recently returned archlich that plagued the end of the Age of Arcanum. You have since discovered the location of his rebirth, followed into the Shadowfell, through the city of Thar Amphala, took down his tower of Entropis, did battle, and nearly fell. You escaped in time, and in this recovery period have been seeking out information on how to stop him before this ascension occurs, and by what tools necessary. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h11m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m44s">You've traveled to the Blessed Fields of Elysium, where you met Pike's deity, the Everlight, Sarenrae, where she received her blessing. You made your way to the Fortress of the Sun, where you met with the Dawnfather Pelor, took his challenge, and received his blessing. You were then given information about the whereabouts of Ioun, the Knowing Goddess, and the domain of knowledge, who had been hidden away since her wounding during the Calamity. The key to her realm was apparently hidden within not an object, but an individual. Given loose information about the whereabouts of this individual, you tracked down a small home in the forested regions outside the Pools of Wittebak in the Cliffkeep Mountains. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h11m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m44s">There, you spoke with this individual, this Sprigg the Obnoxious, and then were immediately assailed by a number of assassins sent by the Whispered One, Vecna, apparently keeping watch on your current location and able to send such groups of assassins with vast haste. You did battle, managed to save the life of Sprigg the Obnoxious, and through conversation, unveiled that he was indeed a key to this realm. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h11m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m44s">Keyleth, by entwining your hands with the rest of the party and focusing on this strange magical essence hidden within Sprigg's form, you completed your Plane Shift spell. You found yourself suddenly within a dimension of an endless library, shelves of winding books and tomes that spiral beyond sight. In the midst of this amazing atmosphere, a voice called you to a central portion of the chamber. There, it seems, you've come across the Knowing Mistress, Ioun herself, there awaiting your arrival. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h11m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h14m38s">So you glance around, your vision darting from shelf to stack, the dark-lit areas empty of anything but empty vessels carrying books, until you see it. The shelves have stopped ahead to reveal a circular common area within the library where the ground domes downward, an 80-foot concave pit of cushions and tables all standing at odd angles without sliding, holding tea cups and writing implements against gravity as you know it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h14m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m38s">Long spiralling streams of silver, blue and grey silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight, the material resting in gentle piles amongst the cushions-- sorry, microphone-- against the cushions. Sitting within the center of the dome, no larger than a normal person, is an older woman of long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is somewhat weathered with wrinkles but the warmth of her smile and her vibrant purple eyes put you at ease. Her blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that snake through the pillows like roots of a giant tree. This is the Mistress, and she beckons you forward. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=0h14m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>

They continue to push at a brisk pace and you watch as other of the spectral librarians begin to gather into this group and is now a cluster of about 25 of them that are snaking around these bookcases and traveling at a pretty fair pace.

Then eventually, at about the 40-minute mark or so, you come to the outside. What's interesting, too, is a lot of these bookcases are made of different materials. Some of them are dark wood, light wood, some of them are metal and various substances. You come to, on the ceiling, jammed in, a bookcase, but it's made of a very dark slate gray metal.

The cold, cloud-covered sky, but you see below grass and recent rainfall-covered fields that lead to a somewhat marshy and mud-covered shoreline. There, you see a small fishing village leading out to a rocky beachfront and waves that crest and break against a drop-off into the ocean. You can see some low-built docks that lead all the fishermen in and out into the ocean. The vision pulls you back miles away from that. You get a sense, as you see this small column of black smoke that emerges from the ocean across endless open sea, that is the signal of where this volcano lies. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=1h10m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Now, to forge such a trammel, "however, is an undertaking no mortal has attempted. To shape the materials would require "the strength of a titan." She looks towards you and the eye flashes and suddenly your mind fills with hundreds of years of the knowledge of folding heated metals, of the clinks of lives past, shaping and building weapons and armor and for a second you pull back and you can see the large dwarf-like stone form of the Allhammer, slamming down onto the heated metals of the Core Anvil.

<dd id="l1h17m39s">"I know as much of his history as I was allowed to see, yes. Vecna was a force of "insurmountable intellect among mortals, and his creative bending of known arcane theory enabled "many of the powerful artifacts of war that stoked the flames of the Calamity a century later. His "contributions were appreciated, but overlooked by those around him. In his hubris, he sought to "carve history in his image. He sought forgotten magics and slew those who shared this same "knowledge to leave only him standing with it. He bypassed his own mortality through terrible "necromantic rites to lichdom, amassing a force of like-minded followers and hordes of undead "terrors, then vanished into the Shadowfell to overtake the dark city of Thar Amphala, where he "erected the terrible tower Entropis. From this very seat of power, Vecna harnessed an event "called the Celestial Solstice. He used this merging of ley energies and power to reforge "manses of energy all across Exandria to suit his needs, opening the portals at his whim within his "city to anywhere across the world, allowing his armies to lay siege to anything before him and "extend his influence and rule. His horde assaulted a couple of prominent townships, slaughtering "denizens and forcing old enemies to kneel, before slaying and raising them as his own. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=1h17m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h17m39s">"One such rival was named Kas, who, upon their defeat, was offered eternal life through vampirism "in exchange for swearing fealty to Vecna as his chief lieutenant. This made Kas into Kas the "Bloody-Handed. Vecna forged a relic blade for him with a fraction of his consciousness and gifted it "to his new lieutenant, and with this, the lich lord had become a new terror among the rising "tensions of the bickering nations. Months of turmoil followed as the shadow of Vecna's "unstoppable forces struck with precision and those fled before retaliation. However, the use of the "Solstice was discovered and reverse-engineered, allowing the holy army the Beacon of Arms to storm "his city under the banner of the Dawnfather, led by the champion Yos Varder. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=1h17m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h17m39s">"Climbing Entropis to face the lich lord in combat, Yos Varder was struck down by the Undying "King with a mortal blow. In the final moments of the hero's life, he witnessed the lieutenant Kas "turn on his winded master and strike him with the very blade he was gifted, driven to usurp him, to "become his own, new lord. The ensuing conflict left Kas nothing but ash, and utterly destroyed "Vecna's body, leaving nothing but his left eye and hand. Yos passed on to the realm of Pelor, due to "his wounds, and the survivors left the Shadowfell with tales of victory. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=1h17m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h17m39s">"The terrible artifacts: the eye, the hand, the sword, were never recovered. The sword is bent on "vengeance, on hatred for the Whispered One.

She opens her robe, and there you can see amongst the olive-gold skin, you see a large darkened gash that still festers, unhealed to this day, of black, curling void. As you look at this open wound, you feel yourself drawn toward it; your vision begins to be pulled towards this infinite nothing. She closes it.

It glows faintly, and as she removes it, you hear a terrible creaking sound throughout the library. You watch as books plummet from the darkness above and slam into the ground around you. Distant cases crack and bow. The roar of the damaged space echoes to a halt, the danger seemingly in control. "There. I can spare no more.

<dd id="l3h28m24s">I mean, limp. The muscles went lax. Okay, so as you guys were propping this up, you complete your scrying on Shorecomb, and what you do is you get a vision of the central area of the city, right near the cliffside. There's these sheer cliffs that drop off for maybe a couple hundred feet and lead down to the gravelly, rocky beach; dark rocks, pebbles, they go out about 30 feet until they hit the water, and that's where they have these wooden steps that wind down the side of the cliff that lead to the docks, and they have winches and cranes that lift heavy objects to and from the docks to get actually into the city. You do see a lot of the trees are very thin, but within the actual city proper, you see a handful of larger trees that at this time, because it's pushing into the end of winter, beginning of spring, a lot of them are leafless, but possible to use your Transport via Plants with.

Your vision pulls out of your body, rockets once again through the stratosphere, the darkness. It's hard to place direction, but your essence is drawn back down through the clouds, over the center of a rocky mountain range covered in snow and ice. Another flash, and there you are amongst the city of Thar Amphala. There's another flash, and you see a hole in the ground, a large carved tunnel, you see hooded figures, blurry at the edges of this vision, emerging. And there you see, stepping out of the tunnel, Delilah Briarwood, with both eyes. Steps out. Her hood up, pulls it back. She glances off to a direction you can't see and goes, "It's "almost ready."

Bald head, deep blue skin, with beautiful white angel wings that unfurl for 24 foot, tip to tip length, you feel holy power surge through your body. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Wl1Oi8Rbc1s&t=3h40m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
