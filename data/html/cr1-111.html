<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hi, everyone! Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Good job, Sam. Thank you for your patience. Sorry we were off last week. I'm doing much better, for those who are worried about it. Happy to be back. Missed you guys, and happy to be back at this table. So yeah! It's been a couple of weeks. Let's go ahead and get into some announcements real fast. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">First off, tonight we have our fantastic sponsor, Shadow of War! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m31s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h0m37s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m37s">Are we allowed to say what we did in it? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h0m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m40s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m40s">Yeah, a number of us actually worked in the game. It comes out October 10th, actually. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h0m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m48s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m48s">And the full name of the game is Middle Earth: Shadow of War, for all of those who are looking for it alphabetically. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h0m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m54s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m54s">The sequel to Middle Earth: Shadow of <i>Mordor.</i> <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h0m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m56s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m56s">Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling our asses off. I played a little character known as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording sessions. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h0m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m11s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m11s">I remember talking to you! I was Commanding Orc 1. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m14s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h1m16s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m16s">I was Professional Orc 1, as well as the Witch King of Angmar, the head of the Nazgul. I'm pretty excited about that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m28s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m28s">Oh, nice! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m29s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m29s">I was Troy Baker's fluffer. It's prestigious. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m35s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m35s">You were in it, right? No? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m38s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m38s">I'm in the first one. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m40s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m40s">Oh, what did you do in the first one? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m42s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m42s">The thing I killed two weeks ago? That was me. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m49s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m49s">Laura, were you in it? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m51s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m51s">I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m56s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m56s">You play a sword?! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m58s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m58s">I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf, right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be about my character. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h1m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m6s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m6s">Do you have a number after your character? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m9s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m9s">No, it's the only one. It's the coolest thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and Vax. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m21s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m21s">That's pretty great. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m22s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m22s">No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m22s">So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and she wears feathery armor. It's so freaking cool! So basically, it's like if Vax was a girl, which is Vex. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m36s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m36s">But with the sex appeal of Grog. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m38s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m38s">Of course, baby. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m39s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m39s">I will never forget being at the Shadow of War panel at Comic Con, and you mentioning the DLC and then going, "Has that even been announced yet?" And there was five seconds where I watched Laura wither away into a shell of a human before they went, "Oh, yeah, it's announced." And you reverted. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m53s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m53s">Even at this very moment, as I said it, aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h2m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m0s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m0s">They scare you so bad that, even when it's official, I'm like "I'm in the--" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h3m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m6s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m6s">It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h3m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m6s">We can testify. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h3m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m11s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m11s">We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right <i>into</i> the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h3m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m36s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m36s">And make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h3m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m42s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m42s">By the way, if you haven't played the previous game, the Nemesis system is one of the coolest things I've played in many games in a long time. I'm going to challenge you guys to try and pick out not only who you voice orc-wise, but then to try and make sure our orcs rise to the very top. So you have nothing but generals from Critical Role. I challenge you for this. Because that would be pretty cool. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h3m42s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m3s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m3s">I hope you like hearing the word ranger. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h4m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m6s">#</a> <strong>LIAM, TRAVIS, LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m6s">Ranger! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h4m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m13s">It's going to be fun. All right, thank you, Shadow of War for being our sponsor tonight. We're excited about the game, and hope you are, too. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h4m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m13s">Also, there's been a lot of insane weather tragedies that have been in the news recently. I want to make sure that everyone knows that if you want to help support relief for both of the hurricanes that have come and torn through the U.S., we have a link to the Red Cross to donate and be part of that. It'll be available in the chat and throughout the rest of the game tonight, so if you have the opportunity to help out, I highly recommend it. Come help these people that have lost a lot in the past couple weeks or so. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h4m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m13s">Give what you can. I've given, and we really appreciate that support. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h4m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m1s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m1s">They'll let you delineate between Harvey and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m1s">Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma, the damage is still accruing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m13s">I grew up in Florida. I know the area well, and I have family out there that endured it. It's very close to me. So if you can, greatly appreciate it. Let's see here. Merch! Laura. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m28s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m28s">This feels so weird to say after you mentioned that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m32s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m32s">Nah, but we make happy stuff. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m34s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m34s">Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m40s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m40s">Ooh! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m43s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m43s">I'll show it to you, and my back brace, to make it really better. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m47s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m47s">Are we selling those in the store? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m50s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m50s">The back brace? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m51s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m51s">Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m59s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m59s">We missed an opportunity to put Backblaze on that back brace. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m59s">(groaning) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h5m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m3s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m3s">Next time. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h6m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m5s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h6m6s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m6s">No next time! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h6m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m10s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m10s">There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h6m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m10s">They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h6m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m46s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m46s">Thank you, Laura. Also reminding you guys, we have up to episode 40 of Critical Role now released on iTunes, Google, and geekandsundry.com has all the information for it. So if you want to listen to the podcast, or your friends have been like, "I don't want to watch it, but I just want to hear it." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h6m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m1s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m1s">I want to watch it, but I don't want to <i>watch</i> it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h7m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m3s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m3s">It's good for commutes. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h7m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m5s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m5s">Also, clarification, speaking of saying things prematurely before I should have. I've gotten a lot of questions being like, "What happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said it, and then I looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But do not announce this part." Which, why was it even on our announcement sheet? Still my fault. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h7m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m33s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m33s">To be fair, I remember looking down at the sheet as you were announcing it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h7m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m36s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m36s">Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch. So ten at a time. That's what you get. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h7m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m44s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m44s">It's like one cookie at a time. You can't bake one cookie at a time. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h7m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m48s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m48s">It's just better to do them in a block. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h7m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m51s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m51s">Thank you for the heads-up on that. We announced a while back the Critical Role six-issue mini-series comic book. We announced last week that it's going through Dark Horse, which I'm super excited about. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h7m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h8m6s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h8m8s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m8s">Oh, yeah. Dark Horse was my introduction. I was probably in fourth grade when I got into the Alien comics through Dark Horse. I didn't realize there was more to explore. Dude, I've been a fan of them ever since. Being able to take this into their realm is brilliant. I'm so excited. First issue drops on the 20th, guys. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h8m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h12m29s">All right. Well, cool, guys! Thank you so much. Thank you for dealing with our long announcements. It's been a few weeks. However, I think, with that, it's time to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h12m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m29s">[dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h12m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m12s">Welcome back. I'll remember this. Why's everything targeting Scanlan in this battle? Welcome back, everyone. So last we left off, Vox Machina, preparing themselves for a final fray with the recently ascended god, Vecna, the Undying King, discovered that he had brought the city of Thar Amphala about 300 miles northwest, of Vasselheim on the continent of Issylra. Upon gathering allies to assail this region, you discovered that it was shifting, moving. And apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial earth titan had been risen and began marching its way towards Vasselheim with Thar Amphala embedded at the top of its torso, protected by some sort of magical barrier. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h14m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m12s">With an advance army of wyvern riders at your back and J'mon Sa Ord giving you a ride between their wings, you made your way southward. Quickly depositing yourselves within a waterfall, expelling opening towards the hip of this large titan undead beast, you began to fight your way to the interior. Dealing with corrupted earth elemental shards, you began to make your way through the catacombs, the long ruined and abandoned dwarven city of Thomara, where you encountered the tomb of the dwarven king. Where you also managed to raid the tomb, found a magical item, and dealt with some fun traps in the process. Then, continuing to follow where this route led you upward, hopefully towards the underbelly of the city of Thar Amphala, you uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did battle with some undead trolls that immediately rushed in and attacked you. You managed to destroy them, and make your way out through a small cavern that had just momentarily collapsed, clearing out of the way. You all began to squeeze through the opening to find the next length of your journey. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h14m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m12s">And that's where we left off. As you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening, you come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each impact of the feet of the titan you're currently riding within. It seems to be going at a steady incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to 45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h14m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There is no exit door currently visible; the chamber comes to an end. The room looks mostly bare, aside from an eight-foot-tall, five-foot-wide mirror coated in dust, framed in intricate gold and brass that sits across the chamber on the opposite side of where you entered. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=0h40m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h20m47s">You do not find any other traps. There's no other issues that worry you upon this climb. You do eventually come to the top of the third switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight curved cavern. The stairs stop and it leads into a continuation of the dwarf-like hallway structure that you had below, but it is curving around now, in sections. I would say, as opposed to a gradual curve, the design in the structure here has a very rigid, geometric shape, so the curvature is in sections. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=1h20m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

However, this tunnel comes to an end, and it opens up into a larger crevasse than the one that you previously saw that held a number of city buildings of the remains of Thomara. It looks to be about 100 to 120 feet tall, you assume, from the bits of the stalactites that you can see, barely reaching the edge of your visual range. Very faint bit of light here, bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish color that dots the edges of this interior chamber. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=1h21m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The high walls of the temple-like structure begin to reveal themselves, standing ominous over the debris-strewn streets with shattered carts and bone fragments. The bone fragments faintly quaking beneath every footfall of the walking mountain that you currently are walking through. You see long-decomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond reanimation lying scattered across the broken street paths ahead of you, deep grooves marking the splintered bone. A tangled network of partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal themselves above you, carved from the mountain, contains a ghostly image of a multi-level metropolis long fallen.

The Blood Axe hits the edge of a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a corner angle and is currently being held by a small barrel, and as the axe hits it, it shifts (crashing) and rolls and comes to a rest for a second with this clattering, grinding sound. Parts of it chip and break, but most of it remains strong and sturdy upon impact.

<dd id="l1h53m8s">Further in. Nothing directly around the outside of the temple. So you guys curve around the entrance where you came and slowly make your way towards where the temple emerges from the rock wall. About a third or so of its exterior wall is actually built into the side of this cavern, and the large cylindrical-like Colosseum temple structure curves outward. You can see as you get closer to it, there's maybe the three floors to it but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and you can see areas where it looks like it's sustained some physical damage or eroded over time. You eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This is an old temple. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=1h53m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h9m25s">A few of them seem to glance up and see you as you pass and reach, but they have nowhere to go. As you begin to cruise through the center of this cavern, following it to the opposite side, it widens further, and now as you look down, faintly, you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent fungus that are growing within this city below. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=2h9m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h9m25s">You can see some of the catwalks that meet in the center of this actually meet in a suspended platform that contains another dome-like structure that is partially caved in. With another shake and impact of the titan's footfall, you watch as one of its suspension pillars cracks, and the entire center finally gives way and falls and slams down, collapsing into the center of the chamber, it being there for the final moment of its tensile strength. As it slams down, you watch as it crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below, and from that blast, you can see something on the interior of it was apparently explosive or flammable, and it explodes, giving a brief flash of light into the center of this cavern. Where you had the brief outside of your visual range, you now look around and see the entirety of these dozens of catwalks and the city below you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=2h9m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h36m39s">As you begin to climb upward through this 15-foot-wide or so upward hallway, this cylindrical cavern, you continue upward for about 50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of this chamber, and then it opens up into a domed room. Immediately, as you fly up, you see a ceiling come up, and you have to coast off to the side. You catch yourself, hovering there as the rest of you guys make your way in there. This domed, mushroom-shaped chamber with a very thin, circular floor around the outside with the hole that you entered at the bottom. Whoever would stand on the edge there would have the opportunity to either leap into or toss something down into this hole that would then drop them right into the center of the city. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=2h36m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h57m3s">All right, so the two of you very quietly make your way ahead, the rest of you keeping within, I assume, the range of the ring. The staircase doesn't go too far; it goes maybe 30 or so feet, and then it opens into a hallway. You're stepping up through the floor, and there's about ten feet behind and to the sides of you. There's a slight element of a cave-in to the left of you, where part of the stone seems to have collapsed, and a bit of the earth has filtered in. It's a smooth stone floor that's tiled in places. The walls continue on, a somewhat trapezoid-like angle. There are other portions of the wall that have caved in on certain elements, and there are two large pillars that mark the center of this hallway, either used as support beams or decorative, but they go from ceiling to floor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=2h57m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h57m3s">You glance over the side, and you see a distant staircase on the far end of this hallway, maybe 80 to 90 feet from where you are, if not further, with larger stairs. You've seen some of the dwarven-based ones. These seem to be a little more grandiose as they lift up higher and higher. Part of that hallway is completely collapsed; it's a wall of fallen earth. But there's a hole carved out of it. There's a tunnel that has been pushed through. You hear this very faint buzzing sound. Very faint. This (low humming). A very faint vibration. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=2h57m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h57m3s">You also see a figure stepping from a side wall crevasse, an opening of a similar shape to the circular opening in the wall. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=2h57m3s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h59m11s">You hear some muttering across the way in the shadow. There's a faint source of light that looks like a glowing orb that's floating in the air above and giving this faint greenish-white light; a bauble that's giving a light source to whatever this cloaked figure is. You hear the muttering, and two more walk down the staircase to join them.

And as she completes the ritual, she suddenly screams out in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her knees. No effect.

<dd id="l4h19m47s">One by one, you grab and take the corpses and thrust them towards the sphere, as they immediately crumple, fold and get pulled in, turned to nothingness, disappearing into the black void. There are elements of the way the sphere acts and manipulates things that remind you of the siphons, though differently. It's more violent in some ways, and it is its own contained magical entity. With each body, it vanishes in the sphere, and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath and deciding the next order of business in traversing the insides of this titan. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DFGKgYY7SKk&t=4h19m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
