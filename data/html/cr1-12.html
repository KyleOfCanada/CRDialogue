<dd id="l0h1m8s">Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m8s">Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m8s">In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m8s">But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m8s">Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m8s">Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m8s">Also ale! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h1m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m55s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m55s">A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m55s">Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m55s">Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m55s">Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m55s">As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m0s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m0s">Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h5m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m0s">One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h5m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m0s">Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h5m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h5m0s">Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h5m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m14s">#</a> <strong>ASHLEY</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">Her ancestors were a family of Deep Gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream. A dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal, whether it was animals, people, or even flowers. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">She felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">Little did she know that in a few years' time Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m14s">(roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea, training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h6m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h8m16s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h8m16s">Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h8m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m16s">A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h8m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m16s">Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h8m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m16s">Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h8m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m16s">A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h8m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m16s">Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h8m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h8m16s">Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h8m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h9m38s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h9m38s">Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h9m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m38s">From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h9m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m38s">However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h9m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m38s">After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h9m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m38s">I found those answers to be unacceptable. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h9m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m38s">A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h9m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m38s">Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h9m38s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h11m37s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h11m37s">Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h11m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m37s">Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h11m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m37s">After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h11m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m37s">(roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h11m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h11m37s">An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h11m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h13m6s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h13m6s">Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h13m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m6s">Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h13m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h13m32s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h13m32s">Hello, everyone! Sorry for the delay; we had a few folks that were in transit, but we're all good. We're all here now, and welcome to a very special episode of Critical Role. We have a number of members of our party that are on vacation this week, so as opposed to continuing a climactic endpoint of a long 11-12 week story arc, we're going to hold off a week and have them return next week to pick up where we left off, just after the battle with the big bad beholder, K'Varn the Mad. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h13m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m32s">However, this week, what we're going to be doing is, essentially, a little workshop. A class, if you will, on Dungeons &amp; Dragons and roleplaying games in general. For those of you out there that have never played before, for those of you who have played and want to pick up some new skills or ideas, and for many who are out there who have either had a hard time dungeon mastering or have been too scared to try being a dungeon master or game master, depending on your roleplaying game of choice, we're going to try to dispel some of that and give some tips and tricks along the way. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h13m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m32s">So, first and foremost, let's go around the table and say hello to everyone who is here. We have Marisha Ray, who plays Keyleth in our usual campaign. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h13m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h14m47s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h14m47s">So we have the support team here from Critical Role to offer suggestions, answer questions, and help these other guys here I'm going to introduce in a second with their character creation for the end of the evening. I'm going to completely improvise on the spot a short game for these fellows, and we'll see how that pans out. For some of them, their first game of D&amp;D. We shall see how that goes. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h14m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m47s">So let's go ahead and introduce on this side of the table. We have Dan Casey. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h14m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h24m58s">So, we're gonna start here with a little overview of character creation. So, for most RPGs, especially those in the fantasy realm, this will be a very familiar aspect where there are many different game types that run different things, but usually the point goes you choose a race and you choose a class. The race defines your physical background, your family bloodline and what attributes that adds to you. A class is essentially the job or the way you've lived your life going forward and what skills you've acquired because of it. So, throughout the Player's Handbook-- you can go ahead and turn through the first few pages; first couple sections. You'll see there are certain races like the dwarf, whom I love. Dwarves are awesome. Underrepresented. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h24m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h25m45s">Dwarves are cool. They're sturdy. They're strong. They're a little brash. They're, y'know-- If that's something you guys are thinking about as you're coming up with your character ideas, dwarves are fun for that reason. I'm gonna breeze through these 'cause we don't want you to spend 30 minutes on races. We have elves. Elves, you know elves. Lord of the Rings. Elves are cool. They have high elves which are a little more haughty and well-learned. We have the forest elves, or whatever it is they're called. Or are they just the basic-- All right! We have wood elf, there we go. Which are more of the Legolas-style, you know, in the woods, hunting, being stealthy. And then you have the dark elves, which are the drow, that are from actually the Underdark, where you guys have been fighting through, though you have not encountered any drow in the Underdark. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h25m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h26m36s">Yeah.

And then you have the tieflings, who are humanoid but have somewhere in their previous bloodline some contact with demonic forces that left them with some essence of the Hells in their bloodlines.

That's what Grog is. They're big, strong guys. So keep in mind the race you want to play, which is cool. Classes we got! So, we got barbarian. Grog is a great example of a barbarian.

<dd id="l0h28m14s">They use rage as a means of destroying their foes, upping their abilities in combat and preventing mental effects magically affecting them. We have bards. Bards are vastly skilled across the board. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h28m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h28m14s">They have skills of all types, even things they don't know very well; they know a little bit of everything, kind of a jack of all trades. They have some minor spellcasting. They also can inspire other people with songs, speech and help them out with certain skill checks. Bards are pretty cool. We got clerics. Your healers. But you say healer, you're like, "I don't want to be a healer." Clerics also have access to really powerful divine magic, so while people may be, "Oh, Clerics are dumb, you heal the party," they can also call down divine judgment, which is great. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h28m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h30m1s">Indeed. We have fighters! Fighters are just straight-up fighters. Imagine what a fighter is. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h30m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h30m1s">That's a fighter. They can use all armor and all weapons. They can generally get more attacks than other classes. They're generally like the marshal, the generals, the warriors, the pit fighters. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h30m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h30m1s">They're just more rough and tumble, let's just damage each other. We've got monks! Monks. Crazy fast. Punch and do awesome damage with their bare fists. They can avoid things; they can do multiple hits per round; they can use ki points to inflict different types of attacks. Monks are basically: if you wanna be Ip Man in the middle of a D&amp;D campaign, pick a monk. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h30m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h31m13s">We got rangers, which is what Laura's character, Vex'ahlia, is. They have good either two-weapon or ranged combat. They can pick a companion animal if they want to, that's how Trinket came about. Y'know, definitely the Legolas of Lord of the Rings type. Arrow, arrow, arrow, everything's getting arrows. Arrow'd! And they got rogues, which is what Liam plays in our game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h31m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h31m13s">Rogues are all about stealth, stabbing in the back, finding weak points of their enemies and doing serious damage with precision strikes by distracting their enemies and finding where their weak points are. They generally don't have a lot of hit points or defenses, but if they can get in there sneakily, they'll do some serious damage. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h31m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h31m13s">Then we got sorcerer, which Tiberius is, which is a magical caster, arcane-based. Whereas a wizard is more of like the classic wizard you see with giant spell books-- learning and, y'know, Harry Potter-style classes and that kind of learned magical ability-- sorcerers have it innately in their blood from their bloodlines somehow. And their casting ability is kind of like an improvised thing they just learned and are good at, so imagine more of a less-learned, less-controlled wizard that mostly understands some magic naturally. Whereas the wizard is the, y'know, the well-learned spell book type; more studious; have a larger breadth of spells to pick from. But the sorcerer's a little more improvised and can use points to instill power with it. Last but not least, we got a warlock. Warlocks are magical practitioners who draw their magic from making a pact with some otherworldly entity. It can be like demons or the Nine Hells and they draw more hellfire and infernal-type magics. They can make a pact with dark fey, which are basically like creepy Oberon-style, y'know, fairy elf people from A Midsummer Night's Dream; or the Great Old Ones, like Cthulhu. Hi, Cthulhu, give me magic. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h31m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h34m18s">So, for each of you guys, let's go ahead and roll up some stats for you. So what you do to decide what your attributes are for your characters, that basically says how strong they are; how hearty their physicality is; how fast they are. And you have strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma. Those are the six stats. So, for you guys, if you want to go ahead and take-- There are different ways of rolling stats. Some people do a point-buy system where you start with a certain base stat and you can buy based on points. For this, we're gonna use my favorite system to do, which is you roll 4d6-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h34m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h34m53s">Drop the lowest. Arrange as desired. So I guess for those of you who haven't seen how the dice work, there are different dice values in the game. You have a d4, which is a four-sider dice. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h34m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h34m53s">So it's the little caltrop. Painful to step on. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h34m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h34m53s">You got a d6, your typical six-sided dice; d8, which is a little more pointy, that's an eight-sider. You got a ten-sider, which comes in two varieties: regular or additional numbers-- this is if you're doing percentage rolls, you know what the percentile dice numbers are. Pardon me. A d12, which is only really used if you're a barbarian, apparently. It's the saddest and the red-headed stepchild of D&amp;D. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h34m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Most all decisions are based on a 20-sided dice. We'll get into that in a little bit. So, for the statistics, I need you guys to go ahead and take 4d6-- so four six-sided dice.

<dd id="l0h40m0s">(laughter) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h40m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h40m5s">We'll see where everyone's constitution lies in a bit. So, stats? Ten is average, and then every two above a ten creates a modifier. So, like a 12? That stat, it has a +1 modifier. At 14, it's a +2. At 16, it's a +3. 18, a +4, and so on. And what that modifier is, is it's the bonus you get to any ability or attempt you make towards something that falls under that stat's category. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h40m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h40m5s">Like, if you're trying to break through a door, you'd roll a d20 and add your strength. Y'know? Or if you're trying to, like a lot of the-- The reflex saving-- or the dexterity saving throws, it's based off your dexterity, you'd roll a d20 and then add what your modifier would be for your dexterity. So those modifiers based on your stat are what affect your d20 rolls for most everything you do in the game. Let's see. So those are the stats. We'll get to skills here in a moment. Well, you guys will go over the specifics of that with them. But everyone should be at a proficiency bonus of +2. You should see at the top left of your sheet, it says proficiency bonus. Above your stats. Put a +2 in there. Now under each class, in your section, it'll have a section for skills. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h40m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h40m5s">It'll say which skills you're proficient in. Under proficiencies. And it'll have you choose a few. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h40m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h40m5s">What you do is, in the character sheet you have these nice little bubbles here that you get to fill in next to those skills. Those mark which ones you're proficient in. So you can go ahead and choose those, and fill 'em in. Let's see. I think for now, if you guys want to go over and help them get their classes a little underway of getting the minutia of that building process, I'm gonna jump into the next section of this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h40m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h42m20s">All righty. So! Let's move on to the next section here. Welcome to the role of a Dungeon Master, or Game Master of this. So, there are a number of things that you're required to be when it comes to Dungeon Mastering. Largely, your goal is to be a fair judge. You take all the actions and the activities and the intent and the phrases that the players do, and you judge whether or not it was a good attempt or a bad attempt, and modify a difficulty based on it. Basically, for most things that are actively a challenge in the game, you as the Dungeon Master decide how difficult it is given the circumstance. If it's a really, really weak door someone's trying to kick through, like the door's been dilapidated and rotting, you might say it's pretty easy, so you give it like a score of seven to ten as the difficulty. And then whoever's trying to break it has to roll equal to or higher than that number. If it's an iron-reinforced door, that's gonna be a much higher number. So a lot of what you're doing is you're judging how difficult a challenge currently is versus what a player is trying to do. The player rolls and adds their modifiers, you decide how difficult it is in the back of your head-- you can tell them if you want to or you can keep it in your head-- and then roll off and see if it succeeds or not. And then based on if it succeeds or not, you tell the players what the consequences are of the circumstance. Really low rolls can make for some hilarious botches; really awesome rolls can make for some great heroic moments. So you wanna judge that aspect a lot; it's a lot of what your job is as a Dungeon Master. You're also to rationalize the world around them. So-- If we can keep the volume down just a little bit, guys. It's all good, it's all good. It's all good. So, rationalizing the world around them. Now, what I say about that is, when they encounter NPCs-- which is a non-player character, anyone that's not controlled by the players-- and they have a conversation or they do something in front of them, that non-player character's gonna have a reaction. So you as the Dungeon Master, or Game Master, you decide based on what they've done or what they've said, the personality of the character that you're playing, how they would react to that circumstance. Favorably, unfavorably. And so a lot of your experience as Dungeon Master is rationalizing that relationship back and forth. If they're a really charismatic character that comes, reads the NPC well and kinda sees that maybe-- "They dress well, maybe they like a lot of money," and so they open the conversation about money and how they can be paid. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">That's gonna be a very favorable reaction, so if they're trying to convince the NPC to do something, you might consider a relatively low difficulty. If it's a progressive conversation and the player keeps bungling their words or rolling poorly throughout the conversation, that difficulty might get higher and higher by the end of the conversation for them to finally convince them to do something. So, you're constantly gauging how well they're doing in a social encounter versus how easy it is for the NPC to believe what they're saying. Also, you'll find challenges that are conflicting or versus, where the player rolls versus an NPC. An example of that would be someone trying to deceive somebody, to lie to somebody, versus their insight. And so what you'd do is the player, if they're trying to lie to an NPC, they'd go ahead and roll, add their deception skill and then me as the Dungeon Master, or you as the Dungeon Master, would roll a d20, add that NPC's insight skill-- and if you haven't decided one, you can make one up on the spot based on how insightful that kinda NPC might be-- and compare the two. If they lose, they'd probably believe the player. If they win, they don't and it's your decision whether or not they wanna show that card or go along with it, secretly knowing that they were lying and then have that bite them in the ass later on. So you wanna be a fair judge, and rationalize the world around them and how NPCs react to what they're doing. One of the biggest aspects of being a Game Master, or Dungeon Master, in my opinion, is understanding that you're here to tell a story and you're here to allow the players to be heroes. The reason you play this game is you want that heroic journey. And there are many people that enjoy games that are very versus, very conflicting, and very, like, Dungeon Master versus players, trying to kill them, they're trying to survive; and that's totally fine, too, just make sure up front that you and the players discuss what kind of game you want to play. Nothing's worse than having a player sign on-board, make characters, get a few sessions in and realize that they're now locked into a campaign that is very aggressive and very fight-and-survive, versus what they wanted was a very plain, happy, y'know, fantasy experience, so make sure that you're very open with your players in the get-go what kind of campaign you want to run. In my opinion, it's the most fulfilling if it's a collaborative experience, where you provide challenges, you provide difficulty, you provide high stakes and there is that threat of death, but you never want the players to feel like you're working against them. You want to be a, kind of, an impartial judge and be firm but fair, which is why it's so scary sometimes when they get close to a TPK, because I set it up a certain way, they play it a certain way and you let the dice fall as it does. Or in some cases it works in their favor, like a long-standing boss fight you prepared a lot that they happened to roll really well on and kill your beholder. Totally fine. (laughs) Good for them. 'Cause who knows what's coming next? So, present challenges, present difficulty, but never really with the intent to make the players feel like they're unfairly being beaten down and you're just trying to kill them off in some power-hungry spree, 'cause it just generally ends negatively and badly. Also, in that same vein, you want to reward good thinking, guile, and good in-character actions and roleplaying, and punish reckless, against-character behavior. A good example was Pike, as a cleric, early in the game she was, y'know, beginning to be a little cruel and, y'know, while she is a war cleric, and combat and battle is not unfamiliar to her, cruelty was, and unnecessary cruelty began to fall into a negative point of favor with her deity, Sarenrae, causing the holy symbol to begin to crack and we're kinda seeing where that's gonna play out down the road. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">Conversely, if someone does something really cool in-character or something that really kind of changes the dynamic or has everyone else at the table going like, "Whoa," that's really great and maybe you want to reward them with an inspiration dice, which is-- if you guys have seen the inspiration mechanics-- you can lend inspiration dice to players, which allows them to give a bonus to one of the rolls they make. Our bard, Scanlan, can give those out as an ability, but you as the DM can also give those out if somebody does something really cool. And if someone does something really risky, but really crazy dynamic, even if it seems near-impossible, let them try, let the players try things that are crazy. They might have a really low chance of working and they'll fail spectacularly, and those will still make for great stories and great memories in that game. So, y'know, let the players be heroes, present them with challenges, reward them for good in-character decisions, and try and detract them from making out-of-character decisions that take and rob the fun from the other players, as well. I mean, everyone can play as they want to. If you're running an evil campaign or you have an evil character in a game that's, like, starting to undermine the rest of the party, that can be interesting as long as all the players understand and are down with that type of experience. Once again, that's the conversation you have at the beginning about what everyone's trying to get out of the game. Then, another job of the DM, and one of the other larger jobs, is you build the world. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">You build the world, you help the players tell the story and you work together to find where the story's going from there. I'll get into more detail with that shortly, but you-- This is your tale. You can either buy an existing module which has a pre-built world and you can customize it however you feel; you can play it stringently as to how the module's built; you can expand upon it; or you can do what I do with this and just build everything from scratch and see where it goes. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">It's a lot of work and the DM does have a lot more time they have to put into the game, but it's, in my opinion, one of the more fulfilling experiences you can have as a gamer, because you get to watch all these people play in your sandbox and build their own sand castles and it's kind of exciting to watch them flourish in your own creative space and play off of you. So I, y'know, while I do complain on occasion I don't get a chance to play too often, the experience I have watching other people, y'know, find these moments, they-- Y'know, it's-- To me, it's fascinating and very rewarding, so-- I know it's a lot of front-loading on this, but (laughs) just trying to explain to you the gist of this. So as a Dungeon Master, you want to be a fair judge; you want to rationalize the world around them; you want to try and make sure the players have the opportunity to be heroes and have those heroic moments; reward them for doing good, cool things; try and detract them from ruining other people's fun or doing things that are out of character; and build a world for them to play in. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">So, in these books, and in any RPG book, there are many rules about how to do combat, how to do social interactions, and you can read up on that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">You can take a look at what's in there and, understand, you can play these by the book, completely as they are inside, and it's a great rule system, it works really well. But everything in here, in all these books, are guidelines. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">Anything can be changed, anything can be altered, anything can be customized to how you want it to be. If you don't like how movement or actions work in the game, you can change it however you see fit-- and just notify the players that's the case, of course, otherwise they might feel a little, y'know, taken advantage of if they don't understand the changes you've made-- but, you can change and alter anything you want in the game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">It's just guidelines for you to play off of. I know I've homebrewed a few things and occasionally aspects of being used to Pathfinder bleed over as well, but you just take it as it comes. The bottom line is, as a Dungeon Master or as a Game Master, it's your world and you can-- your word is law. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">People can't really argue with you unless it's a rules question that you didn't clarify before, in which case you kinda have to go in the favor of the player if it's something you didn't clarify, but for the most part you play the part of the overall god of this world and the players also have to respect that what you say goes. That's kinda that weird dynamic between the players and the DM, it's kinda-- it's a respect mechanic, you don't want the players to lose respect for you because then they stop-- well, partially enjoying it, but also they start feeling that antagonistic relationship which can be a little stressful for both points. So, customize the rules as you see fit. We homebrewed Percy's gunslinger class over from Pathfinder, because we just-- when we converted over, there was no equivalent and so we made something up, and we're trying it out, it's a work-in-progress, it's by no means perfect but it seems to be doing okay and it keeps it fun for him without completely changing the dynamic of the character he already created. I know they'll probably release a gunslinger equivalent in the future or something and it might be vastly different from what he has, but we're gonna stick with this because it's what he's used to and it's what he's built his character's personality and combat around. So yeah, just keep that in mind. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">The next bit, and this is kind of a big suggestion point for a lot of you guys. A large part of the DM's time is spent worldbuilding. I say worldbuilding, it's creating all the little details and the aspects of the world you want the players to play in. There are parts that, like, creating a society, building towns and villages, designing dungeons and encounters, all that crazy stuff all comes together into that world that you're creating. Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">Thank you. We have to keep everything down a little bit. But you want to start somewhere and it seems very daunting as a Dungeon Master, especially a new one, to say, "How do I-- How do I create all this-- How do I-- Where do I start?" And that's a difficult question. Sometimes, for your first couple games, it doesn't hurt to look at a module, go out and pick up one of the existing Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure books that outlines for you how a city would be built, how NPCs would be built, and how they would play out and respond to certain circumstances. It's a good way to train yourself to see how that process would look when it's finished, so if you decide to create your own campaign or customize aspects you know where to build off of. If you're building your own world, I'd recommend starting with a small society, a small village or a small town. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">And you're like, "Okay, I'm gonna build a small "town. Where's this town gonna be? What's the topography?" You're like, "Okay, it can be like in "a middle of a forest village," that'd be more natural-based, kind of farmer society. Or it could be your archetypical urban environment with a very thriving trade society, a mercantile-run, y'know, people. It could be a port town, it sees a lot of trade but also has that kind of travel aspect, it's a mixing pot of cultures. Or it could be just a small farm town that's constantly under siege. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">But you want to start with some bastion of civilization, some place where the players can meet other characters, find adventure, find quests and find conflict. So you decide, "Okay, where do you "want this small town to be?" As an example, we'll say this is-- y'know, we'll use the first town they started in the campaign: Stillben. Stillben I built as a swamp town. It is a port town, but it's built in this clutch center portion of a large swamp to the far east of that continent, so you're like, "Okay, it's a swamp town. How big is it?" You think about it. You're like, "How many people "do you think live there? Let's say, maybe-- maybe 600 people." It's not a huge town. It's not very happy living conditions 'cause it's very humid there. The swamp air itself is not very enjoyable to be around, so it doesn't have a huge population, but those that do live there, consistently, they make a good living 'cause they can live through this whole horrible-living swamp experience and can make use of the trade that comes through. So you're like, "All right, about "600 people or so." Then you start breaking down into what factions there might be in that city. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">"Is there a thieves' guild or an element of shadow in the town? Is there a merchant guild? Is there a "builders' guild? Is there a sailors' guild?" Think of what type of work would be available in this town and you start building factions based on that. When you have a faction, then you can start fleshing out NPCs, or non-player characters, that fit in that faction. "Is there a thieves' guild? "How many people in the thieves' guild? Would it have a leader?" You don't have to worry about fleshing out every single member of the thieves' guild, but consider like two or three main NPCs that might be part of that thieves' guild. So you can say, "All right, one of them will be, we'll "say, a female tiefling who's good with longswords." She's trained into longswords. You're like, "All right, cool." So you can just write up her name. Come up with a random name-- you can look up online for random NPC name generators-- and write down her name. We'll say, for this, she's taken her "virtue" name of Edge. We'll call her Edge. So, Edge is a female tiefling leader of the thieves' guild. Now Edge, what about her, aside from being good with longswords, is a dynamic aspect of her personality. Well, is she ornery? Is she very sly and charismatic? Is she the kinda person that lets everyone else do the dirty work and just stays in the shadows or does she like to be kind of the face-man of the thieves' guild? Kinda just decide some sort of a personality aspect to her of those or many other types. You can go ahead and say, "All right, we'll "say she's charismatic as some tieflings get a bonus in charisma." So she likes to be kind of the speaking mouth of the thieves' guild. So you'll say, "She's charismatic; she's well-spoken; and "she does well in social environments." A few quick notes about her personality just to remind you later on, if she pops up, how she would play out. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h42m20s">"She's charismatic." Then you think, and this is one thing that I think every NPC you should write down some aspect of, "What do they want? And what "do they fear?" You can make a shit-ton of really simple NPCs with just the information of their name, what race and class they are, what they want and what they fear; and that's all you really need to branch out any conversation or encounter they go through. So for Edge, what does Edge want? Edge wants respect and money. As Edge-- respect and money, 'cause as the head of a thieves' guild those are the two things that guide her. Yes? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h42m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h59m8s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h59m8s">Are you gonna do the backgrounds for them? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h59m10s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h59m10s">We'll get to that when you finish all the rest of the stuff. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h59m12s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h59m12s">We're doing backgrounds now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h59m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h59m13s">Well, you can do your backgrounds on your way, then. We'll go through it. It's fine. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h59m16s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h59m16s">Yeah, but do it. Do the background-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h59m18s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">It's fine. So! So she wants respect and money. What does she fear? She fears being exposed to the masses for her demonic blood, knowing that this is a suspicious town. You can go that route. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">Or you could say she fears being discovered by her long-estranged, demonic father. Or you could say that she fears-- she fears being alone, and she surrounds herself by thieves and folk that fear her because it allows herself to feel like she's in control of an aspect of her life. These are all different possible fears you can go with. I'm gonna say she fears being found by her demonic father. And so, those notes there say she's a female tiefling, she's a rogue with longswords, she seeks money and respect, she fears being discovered by her demonic father. These are all you need to now play that character and you just need to put those notes aside. And if the players ever find their way in that town asking around and discovering where a thieves' guild might be or if they're finding where, like, they can find a fence to sell stolen goods to or to find information about the seedy underbelly of the nearby town of Stillben in the swamp, they might find different people willing to give that information depending on how their social rolls are. If they're persuading well or, if persuasion doesn't work, you can intimidate the information out of somebody in which they scare someone enough to eventually give up a name, and they'll say, "Edge. Edge is "the one you want to talk to." When they ask around and start finding more information about Edge, they could decide to infiltrate the thieves' guild and find her personally. That might be a little aggressive and you consider, "If a person breaks into a thieves' guild, the thieves' guild will "take that as a sign of aggression and will probably meet them with battle." If they instead try and find a member of the thieves' guild and parley with them, they could persuade them to speak to Edge on their behalf, in which case they might actually have the opportunity of speaking with her one-to-one in a not-quite-as-aggressive circumstance. It can go any which way and that's kind of the-- The interesting part of being a Dungeon Master is you never know what the players are gonna do. You set up these characters, you set up this world and you kinda let them play, and all you're doing is reacting to everything they do, rationalizing how the world would react to what they're doing. So, let's say the players are like, okay, they asked around, they found somebody who did some work with the thieves' guild, they intimidated some information out of them about Edge; you then find somebody you think may be associated with the thieves' guild and you pay them a lot of money and persuade them to go ahead and speak to Edge on their behalf, asking that she would meet with you at this inn at this time. Your party then goes to that inn room and waits for a while. Over a short period of time, it seems like she's not gonna show up, based on how you think she would react to that experience. I'd say she's curious enough that someone sought her out that she would want to hear what they have to say, 'cause there might be money in it. Let's say the party has gained some renown in the local village, perhaps she wants to align herself with these upcoming adventurers, there's always money to be gained there. So you have her knock on the door. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">As the party enters the door, there's nobody there, but at that same moment they hear the sliding of glass, turn around, notice that she slipped in through the back window and is now leaning against the back wall with her arms crossed, waiting expectantly for them to start the conversation since they so openly sought her existence. So now they're in a conversation with Edge. You can decide how to play their personality. If you want her to be as charismatic as you said before, she would bow deeply; you could say that she was happy to introduce herself and, while hearing some things about the party, she's eager to understand what it is they might have to do with her. Let the party explain now what it is that they want from her. Then you decide: does it fall within the respect and money she wants? She could tell them, "I'll help you "with this circumstance, as long as you pay me this much." Or, conversely, "I'll help you with this, "as long as you can talk to so-and-so in the town and get them to drop this bounty on my head." Y'know? You think of what things would fall into her wants and needs the party could do for her and in turn could help them. However, if they've talked around the town, they may notice that she has demonic lineage, and they might bring it up in conversation and see her reaction. She might be very good at hiding that aspect. She might be able to, y'know, to say, "Well, yes, I'm a tiefling "indeed, but, y'know, that is not of my own doing." The players could then go, "Huh. She seems uncomfortable. I'm gonna roll an insight check on this," then roll an insight check-- they roll a d20, adding their insight skill. The DM then, you, privately would go ahead and roll a deception roll, or a persuasion roll depending on what you thought was the circumstance for that, versus their roll and let them know what they read off of her awkwardness. If they roll really low, you'd be like, "She just seems put off by the fact that you've never seen a tiefling." If they roll really well, you could tell them that at the notion of tiefling and demonic blood, she fidgets and looks over her shoulder, seemingly like she's afraid something's following her. Then the party can press her in that regard, and begin to say things like, "Well, if you aren't gonna help us, we have "a warlock friend who does dealings with the infernal and we know your name now. If there's "someone chasing you, y'know, we could call them on you unless you help us." Now it becomes-- as opposed to a persuasion, it becomes an intimidation-based experience; and if they can manage to convince her to help out of sheer intimidation and fearing for what she doesn't want to happen, she becomes an ally, although a much more tenuous relationship. So that's an NPC that I just made up right now and fleshed out. But really, the basis you need for an NPC, to build off any of those circumstances, is: a name, a race and class, what they want, what they fear. Those are some of the biggest things you need to-- everything else can be improvised on the spot. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">Like I said, it's all reactionary as a DM, which is great, because once you set the world, the players drive the story, and you just react off what they're doing and rationalize how the world would react to it. I understand this is a lot of information up front, but I'm trying to get as much information into this talk as I can 'cause we have a limited time and I've had a lot of questions today I'm trying to get through for you guys. So I hope this has been helpful. We'll get to questions in a second so I can answer things specifically to you. So that's an NPC you can create. You can create the same way for like a local cleric, a barkeep. You could be like, his race, he could be a dwarven barkeep. He's not even a fighter; or maybe he once was a fighter, but he gave up the life, used his winnings in some sort of a brawling ring when he was younger to buy this tavern, and that's all he really does, but he's well-connected and has information. What are his wants? He wants money, but he also wants to possibly purchase a tavern across the town that is failing that he thinks could expand his business. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">What does he fear? Being closed down, or possibly getting arrested because of maybe some things he did in his past that are a little shady that he hoped nobody would remember. So now, when someone talks to that innkeep, there are many different ways they could take that conversation, and many different little ideas you might have as gives as to what they're seeking and what they're afraid of. And those are just cool little notes you make to yourself down the road that if they ever decide to enter that tavern and talk to that NPC, you look down and you immediately know where they stand, what they want, what they don't want and how they can help or hinder the NPC-- or the players based on what they do. So that's building a very small town and a small NPC. You flesh out a couple and then you build off from there. And it takes some time, y'know? You can crank out a few NPCs; and you can railroad it as much as you want to. If you don't want to spend a lot of time building a big sandbox game for all your players, you can play a pretty standard, straightforward story. You can decide the players are gonna go to this tavern; the players are gonna go to this, y'know, this home here; they're gonna go to this one mercantile-- this kind of textile warehouse where they're gonna find a hidden underground passage that leads to an altar to some forgotten god. In which case you can decide, no matter what happens, you can send the players-- let them wander a bit and have fun, but let them know very early in, "You hear that there is some shaky business going on in this town. People in the "tavern are whispering about these murders that have been happening in the village. You're like, 'Huh?'" They'll start asking about the murders and that's when you can point them towards, "Well, "we've only heard, y'know, that these people have been being killed when passing around this part of "town; and they arrested one man last week, but he was let go from the suspicions and he lives at "this house." Now the players will be like, "Oh, well we have to go talk to the guy at that house." You lead them to that house. They go talk to the guy. The guy might be like, "I don't know what "you're talking about." You press him for information, you find out that he used to work for this textile business and he-- Eventually you can either drive that he helped with these murders or that he knows who is and they work with this mercantile. Then, now you send them straight to this warehouse that contains all this, y'know, cloth and textile woodwork-type materials. They might break inside, search the place, find nothing, but if they roll well enough they'll find the trapdoor that leads down into the altar. So, that was an example of a very thorough line to a story that you could drive them towards and let them play within that zone. If you have a lot of free time, you could build that; you could build one storyline that deals with one of the local lords that is in danger of having his home completely taken by him because of debt; or you could do another side-story at the same time that has something to do with a local inn, that their basement has recently had a sinkhole collapse underneath the bottom of it that opened up a cavern of a bunch of strange, mutated, y'know, rats that are coming out of some terrible-smelling cavern. And all of these can be just aspects that are in the town at all given points in time the players may find. And you let them discover that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">It still takes a little more time to prepare that, but that's up to you as a DM as to how much your free time is and how much you can prepare for. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">Y'know, don't be afraid to, if you don't have a lot of time, to railroad the players a little bit, as long as you make them feel like they're-- (laughs) they're in control of it; and they are in control of it, too. And I've had a lot of games where I've prepared a bunch and the players decided to go this way, and completely get around everything I prepared and it turns into this big improvisation experience. And that can be very uncomfortable for a lot of people that aren't experienced in a lot of improv, and that's where preparation comes in and kind of your comfort as a DM. I recommend, if you're playing and DMing or GMing a game for the first time, maybe run them through a story that's a little more linear, a little more direct, so you just get more comfortable with the experience, both combat with the players, more experience with how NPCs interact with them and being prepared for those circumstances. Then, as you have more experience as a GM or DM, you can begin to be a little more freeform with your storytelling setup and letting the players kind of play in that sandbox that is the world you've created. So those are some guidelines for like a small village. The factions are fun to create, because you can have factions that are allied, factions that are enemies, and that automatically leads in a really cool idea for some story hooks where you have maybe a thieves' guild has a huge rivalry with the mages' academy. One believes that, you know, shadows is a real way to get business done in the local politics whereas the mages feel that it's more arcane understanding that both socio-political aspects can be controlled by the arcane. Maybe you have one played against the others. The players can choose a faction to align with and there's a whole quest line that way. But now they've made enemies with the opposite faction and now they're having to steer clear of their side. Or they can try and double-agent for both but if that ends up going horribly awry they have now earned the anger of both sides and might have to flee the town and never return. So these are all different cool ways that you can set up faction versus faction or factions working together to give the players story and investment in the world that you are creating. Now, from that small town, you can build an even larger city. Meaning all those same elements I discussed you just expand upon. You build more NPCs. You build an entire district that is shops and stores, maybe in a giant bazaar. You can create a whole district that is just about worship of different gods and deities, and you have different temples assigned to each god and you can find, you can use the gods that are in the book. You can create your own gods that have their own backgrounds and specialties and guiding principles and religions around that. It's up to you. But as you build a larger city, you have to consider how many different people and cultures it's now having to house and facilitate. So it's a little more of a time investment to build a city that much larger, but it's a really cool experience to then have the players wander through that, to continue to discover. Like, the main city of Emon, which you guys have heard about a little bit of, but I'm sure we'll come back to soon in the campaign, you guys will have the opportunity to see it in person, is a vast city. Much like the classic Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, it's the central capital city of this entire region and they've only maybe experienced a fifth of it after a whole almost entire year of exploring it, so there are a lot of examples of that urban expansion that they can go through. And to be perfectly honest I've detailed and fleshed out maybe about a third of the village with loose notes for all the rest. So if suddenly one of the players veered right again and decided to go all the way to the far northern slums, which I have nothing really specifically planned for, I can look through my notes and find out a handful of NPCs and some loose story elements that I made notes of about those northern slums and I can kind of improvise based on those notes and where they want to go in the story to still make it a fleshed out story, and if it's a really heavy story thread that they're following I can just find a way to tie it back into the original thread I was trying to tell, and not necessarily guide them back on the path, but have it still fold into the same story they've been discovering. You never quite know where they're gonna take you. Sometimes the players take you on a ride and you just kinda have to go with it. You don't want to deny the players too much, because you're all in this for that storytelling experience, and they want to feel like they're guiding their own path. If you force them too hard against their wishes in the game, then it feels more like the DM is playing the game than the players are, and that becomes a very tenuous relationship going forward in a campaign. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">The cool note is, the players never know whether or not you're bullshitting or you had it all planned, so even if you go off the rails, as long as you have some notes or are at least acting like you know what you're talking about, for the most part you'll be fine. I've had whole games that have gone by, I've run by the seat of my pants improvising and I just, I don't know what's going to happen and it works out in a really crazy way and finds a whole new story path and you just don't tell the players that that happened. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">(laughs) That's a fun little aspect there. So we talked about urban environments. We've talked about cities a bit, you know, which, in those cities you want to also be mindful of what ruling class there is. Is it an oligarchy? Is it a lordship? Is it a kingdom? Is there an elected official? Is it a township? And that political structure will also be a very, very good way to build those factions below it as well. So the larger your city is, the more elements of that social structure you have to consider and how many layers there are beneath it. Is it a very wealthy city universally? Is there a very, very, you know, high disparity between the upper class and the lower class? These are all really cool ways to flesh it out and give you ideas on where NPCs can be and where tension is in that society. Also remember, just because you're in a city doesn't mean there aren't dungeons. Castles and keeps have dungeons. Some cities are built on the ruins of older, older cities that may have underground cavern networks that have been long forgotten or tombs that haven't been touched in years since a strange wave of necromantic energy began to rise things from the grave and they just seal it off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h59m18s">But who knows what lurks beneath there. Or, like earlier at that tavern I told you about that had a strange sinkhole, that's a really cool story arc to lead into an underground cavern network to something that may have caused the sinkhole. Something long forgotten beneath that inn that now threatens the inn or possibly the town its entire self. You know, don't be afraid to have players in a city environment still find creepy, interesting, weird terrain within that city environment. In Emon the players managed to fall through a cistern into a deep, dark underground cavern network that led them through an ancient ruined city, finding a hag that managed to make a proposition with them, whereas for information leading them out she took a bit of Tiberius' luck-- he still doesn't know what that means and it still floats above his head. I think he's forgotten about it, but a portion of his fortune has been stolen by this hag, it still resides in that realm. So, urban environments can be urban but don't be afraid to explore avenues above and below. How you doing? How we doing? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=0h59m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h16m0s">Pretty good. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h16m2s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">Cool bit. I'm gonna finish up here real fast with some other ideas. So those are cities. Those are towns. What makes them so special is, in the D&amp;D world, and in a lot of RPG worlds, outside of those bastions of civilization is a very dangerous world. And you can change that up however you see fit, but I find that it definitely makes for a better environment if the players understand that in the wild you find things that are wild. There are creatures that roam free. There are monsters and beasts that call these places home and need to eat and survive. There are intelligent entities that are building their own civilizations in the darkest depths of the mountains or in the shadowed patches of the local forests and going outside of a town, most traveling caravans need to have muscled support hired to come along the way. If you travel alone there is always the possibility of bandits ransacking you on the road or some sort of large hulking beast comes tumbling out of a nearby cavern structure and attacking the, you know, the people. There's so many different ways that you can incorporate a dangerous, wild world around these bastions of society, these little points of light, that makes the game feel more dangerous. It heightens the stakes for the players whenever they have to travel, and it makes returning to a town that much more of a breath of fresh air. Then, consider villains. Villains are NPCs that inherently have very selfish goals that are detrimental to society at large and/or the players. K'Varn being the Big Bad of the recent arc. He is definitively one of the main villains if not the main villain of this arc. You can create villains that are kind of one-offs like this. They eventually found K'Varn and they killed him. You can create villains that are long-standing and recurring. Like earlier in the campaign, the Dread Emperor was always present, but they didn't even manage to find him until the very end. That was a recurring theme throughout, kind of built that tension about that villain. And not all villains get killed. Some villains, when they're damaged, they get the heck out of Dodge and return later even more prepared and more ready, you know. But sometimes the players can be clever and keep them in there-- and don't deny the players if they're really smart and prevent your villain from escaping when he tries to. 'Cause you don't want-- you want to reward the players for being really smart. Remember, good villains are also very smart and usually have a pretty strong exit strategy if everything goes to shit. So villains are a really cool thing to flesh out their persona and their personality. You look at a lot of great literary archetypes that can expand on that for you. You consider like, you know, the Chaotic Evil-type villain, which is the Joker from Batman. Someone who just like loves the idea of violence and destruction and ruining the world around them for their own personal enjoyment and personal gain. You have the Lawful Evil villain-- more of the Darth Vader types-- that work in a structure of law but use it to their advantage. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">They twist people's ideals of honor and society and relationships to put them in a position of power in which no one can really contradict, what they say goes. And through that, they maintain power and they maintain control over people around them. Then you have just general evil. You have all sorts of different types of evil archetypes you can play with in there, but have fun fleshing out a villain and having them be as sadistic or as controlling or as charismatic and enjoyable for the players to encounter, as much as they hate them, you know, you can have a vast variety from there. But recurring villains are a fun theme and generally up the experience more than just having a Big Bad every session that they go in and kill, get the loot and leave, you know, it's fun to have that recurring element. I'm gonna cruise through a couple of points here for you guys, so we can start getting to these guys to playing here. Or any questions they have for the story. Story hooks. Story hooks are essentially what gets the players to start seeking the story, and there's a lot of great examples in the Dungeon Master's Guide here, if you guys pick up a copy, that explains a lot of different ideals of how you can get the players invested in your story. Let's see if I can find it real fast back here, but essentially a story hook could be when they enter a tavern they notice that someone in the corner is hunched over and eventually falls forward off their stool. The party goes and inspects and finds out that they've been stabbed and are bleeding out, and in their dying words they reach up to the player. They whisper a name, like, oh shit, what is that name? What does that mean? And someone in the room is like, that name, that's the name of the leader of this one temple of Pelor, the God of the Sun, the God of Light. Okay, well, the players now have the idea that someone got murdered and their last words were the name of this person. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">Let's go find out what their relationship was. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">That's a story hook. Someone got murdered mysteriously and you only have a name to go off of. That's an example of a cool story hook that the players might be interested in pursuing. Some players might be, "Ah, fucker died. Whatever." and that story hook goes away. But that's up to the players and that's going to put them in the territory of being a little more neutral to evil than good players. So if they make good characters and they do stuff like that, repeatedly, they might start pushing into the evil territory and maybe drawing the ire of other NPCs nearby that are good. The captain of the guard rushes in and inspects, "What happened to this man?" and you're like "I don't know, he died." He's like, "Grrr, I "don't like the look of these people who don't care about the lives of others." Maybe going forward, whenever they encounter the captain of the guard, he immediately mistrusts the party, and they've already established that relationship negatively. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">So let's see, what's some other good examples of story hooks they have here in the book? (sings) 71 and 72. We'll see if they've got that up. All right, bear with me as I pan through. And like, there's a lot of great breakdowns for villains and NPCs and stuff in the Players' Handbook, guys, so if you're planning to Dungeon Master a game I highly recommend you read through. It's a really, really great resource. Ah, all right, 71. All righty. So there are a bunch of cool dungeon goals and wilderness goals, like "foil a villain's evil "scheme", "destroy a magical threat inside a dungeon", "acquire a treasure", "rescue a captive" -- these are cool dungeon goals. They have it broken down into wilderness goals as well, like "establish trade with a distant town", "map a new land", "find a natural resource", "escape the "reign of a tyrant". And you have other cool ideas for goals. "Defending a location from attackers", "retrieving an object from a caravan", "infiltrate a fortified location", "successfully travel "through an obstacle course to gain recognition or reward". These are all very loose, very simple story hooks and goals that you can then weave a story around based on how you've built your town and you've built your NPCs. So don't be afraid to go ahead and grab a copy of these, this can kinda be used as an example if you're feeling a little lost through their story. You can actually just roll randomly on these players and be like, "All right, what are they doing today? Oh well, ah, "looks like they're infiltrating a fortified location. Let me come up with some bullshit that, "you know, justifies what they're doing." So you can, technically, DM a game randomly by just rolling off these and improvising from that point forward. That's a little more of an advanced Dungeon Master technique if you really feel like just winging it from there. But that's a really cool resource to have at your disposal. Another question, another thing I wanted to bring up with you guys was encounters. So when you do get into battle or when players encounter creatures or monsters or villain characters and they want to fight, you then go into an encounter, and you want to consider when you prepare for encounters, you think, where are they? Are they fighting in a dungeon or are they fighting in forest or are they fighting in a swamp? Are they fighting in an open plain? And you go through a book like the Dungeon Master's, or sorry the Monster Manual, and find creatures that you think would live in that type of topography. So if they're in an open field, you can think of more wild beasts or, you know, clans of roaming orcs. If they're in deep, deep mountains you can find creatures that burrow and naturally live in more earthy-based terrain, and you build encounters around that. There are some really great websites online that have encounter calculators where you can basically tell how difficult an encounter is based on how many players are in the party, what level they are, and you can build the encounter based on that. That way you don't end up accidentally making something that's too difficult or too easy for the party. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">And you don't want to make everything too hard. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">Some battles can be fun and easy and really kind of have the players enjoy being badass and rushing into combat and just killing things really easily and being, 'Ha-ha! I ruined everything! That's great! I am powerful!" And you can have some battles that are pretty, "Phew, that was close. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">That was a good fight." And then occasionally you want to throw them a curveball and have something they really have to struggle through, so when they finish that battle they really have to take a rest and realize, "We almost lost one or more people in "that fight," and that makes the stakes that much higher at that point, but you don't want to constantly be hitting them with super-hard battles. You don't want to be making things consistently too easy because it isn't a fun challenge for them. And consider terrain for combat, too. Not every battle is just you versus monsters. Sometimes there's a big cliff involved and the battle could be at a distance. Sometimes there's pits of lava in the middle and that becomes a danger or a tool depending on how you look at it during the battle. Sometimes, especially in urban combat, you have rooftops and alleyways in which you can use that to your advantage to avoid things, or push guys off a roof to fall and get hurt. Or fall onto things, you know. There can be traps involved that you know are there that you can then push guys into. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">There's a really cool way of building encounters that are beyond just hitting things and doing damage. Which is fine, too, don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">Also, if there's a monster in the Monster Manual that you like-- like, this is a really cool monster, but it's too easy, like the players are all level ten and this is a level three monster, you can customize the monster. You can make the monster more powerful. Add more hit points. Raise the stats a little more. Give it a couple of unique attacks that you think would be fitting for it. If you don't like the fact that the bulette only has like a bite and stomp attack, maybe you decide that this bulette actually grew up or was raised around some sort of arcane, natural arcane relic that infused it with a resistance to magic and a capability that it has like electrical charges around it, and now when everyone, whenever anyone starts their turn next to it, they get shocked. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">It's an electric bulette! That's kinda cool. Why not? You can customize and alter any aspect of any creature in the book. Once again, all guidelines. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">You can go with the basis here, and it's a lot easier if you don't have a lot of time, but don't be afraid to customize and alter things to fit certain aspects of your world or your story as you see fit. It's great. I had the players in this campaign fight a proto-lich when they were level three or four. Liches will wipe the floor with pretty much anything, but I considered it would be cool to introduce that powerful undead aspect if it was like just barely cresting out of its initial ritual to become a lich, in which case it was in a very weakened state. So if they had waited a day or two, that lich would have ruined them. It was still a tough battle, but they caught it when it was still essentially birthing, which made it a very, very weak lich. That's not in the books. I just took what was there and scaled it way back. That made for a really fun encounter. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">So, all guidelines. You can customize as you see fit, and there are great communities online of people that create creatures or beasts and have suggestions or feedback for anything you create. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">Don't be afraid to reach out there. Once again, I apologize, because this is a lot of information up front for trying to squeeze this in for you. Also, maps! You see in Critical Role we do combat with maps that we draw up of terrain and we have everyone has individual models and the creatures have models. That is not necessary. I have found it's very helpful for our campaign because we have eight players, which makes it very difficult for everyone to keep in mind spatial awareness during the battle, who is who and what they're doing and how close monsters are. I grew up playing Dungeons and Dragons and other RPGs without maps or models at all. It was all theater of the mind, all in the brain, which is a lot of fun, but when you get a certain critical mass of players it becomes unwieldy, so the the models became necessary for us, but what we're doing tonight when we play our game, there's going to be no battlefield, no models. It's all going to be just keeping it in your head and me letting you know what's happening and where you guys are, so don't feel like it's absolutely necessary to do that. I just find it makes it easier when you have more players. And it's fun to draw maps. Sometimes it's a lot of fun to do that. Another question that has come up a lot. Experience points. So, monsters that are killed or defeated in battle give you experience points. They don't necessarily have to be killed to get that experience points. If the players still win the encounter, meaning they forced them to surrender, or they managed to fight them to the point where they have to retreat. That is still a victory and the players should still get the experience for that encounter. You may give them a bonus if it's a big boss fight and they killed it and then get to reap the rewards of it. That's cool. That's totally up to you as a DM, but, you know, if they still successfully complete an encounter they still get the experience. If they flee from an encounter and the players technically lost the battle, you can still give them a little bit of experience to gain from that, but it would be largely docked by that, and that's totally up to you. That's combat experience. What about role-playing experience? That's arbitrary based on what you want to do as a DM. You can just write down, well that's cool, they get five hundred experience for that social encounter. You can make it up on the spot, and I recommend keeping an eye on what level the players are and what the experience values are for each level, so you know how much they need to get to the next level. That allows you to kind of build a structure. Now for me, to keep track of roleplaying experience, it's an endeavor with eight players, so what I do is I have what I call a hatch marks system, where whenever anybody does something in the game that's a cool roleplaying experience or they save a circumstance I will give them a hatch mark next to their name. Or multiple hatch marks if it was really, really clutch and really kind of changed the dynamic of the circumstance and saved their bacon. Or if they failed miserably at something but they gave it a really, really good try and it was a cool idea, I might still give them a hatch mark or two, 'cause it was a good shot. And so at the end of each game I have a kind of an equation for myself where I multiply their level by 25, so right now they're all level ten, it would be 250 experience and that's-- I give them that many, I multiply it by the number of hatch marks they get. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">So if somebody gets three hatch marks in a game, right now, they would get an additional 750 experience points at the end of that session based on the roleplaying experience. So that way I don't have to think too much about the math in the game, I just go, "That's cool." Hatch mark. "That was "really cool!" Hatch mark hatch mark hatch mark. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h16m2s">And then at the end of each session I'll go ahead and multiply the level by 25 and then multiply that by how many hatch marks I've given them and that's their total roleplaying experience. That's worked well for me. It's not for everyone, but I think it's a good way to quickly add up those moments and make sure players don't feel like you're slowing it down to keep track of who's done cool shit. That's a really condensed overview of Dungeon Mastering. Um. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h16m2s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h30m34s">They've asked me a lot of questions via Twitter and that's kind of what I've built this up for, so I apologize for you guys. Thank you for being patient. We're going to take a couple of questions from the chat room, and then we're going to go ahead and start the game here in about 15, 20 minutes or so. So, as I said, I hope that's a lot of information for you guys, but Dungeon Mastering, it's a lot of fun. It takes some time. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h30m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h30m34s">You have to kind of set aside some time. I say generally it takes about an hour of gameplay per hour of preparation, so if it's going to be a six-hour session it might take anywhere from three to six hours to set up for that properly, but it doesn't have to be that long, that's just me being super thorough, which I'm obsessive about. But yeah, be open to improvise, be open to let the players play and let them guide you sometimes in an off-direction, and have fun. Let the players be heroes. Let them try anything, just know that if what they're trying is really ridiculous, they have a really, really low chance of succeeding, and most of the time they'll fail and it's a spectacular failure and you'll all laugh about it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h30m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h30m34s">If they succeed that roll, that is an epic fucking moment that you're all gonna remember, because that player pulled off that third-act amazing maneuver that completely changed the dynamic of the story and that's really what this game is all about. I still remember and tell stories from our campaign like it was something we all personally did and experienced. It's really weird. It's weird! I love it! But it's weird. So, I love it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h30m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h30m34s">Playing the game is great. Learning the rules is great. Dungeon Mastering is a lot of fun. It's scary at first, but I guarantee with a little bit of time, it's really rewarding and it's really, really not that hard at all. So yes. Let's answer a few questions in the chat room, guys, let's see if you can chime in on this. We'll take about ten minutes of this and and then we'll jump into the game with you folks.

<dd id="l1h33m6s">(laughter) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h33m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h33m9s">But that became an issue with a lot of big battles, I found, especially with eight players, so they simplified that in this edition. Most modifiers to hit and damage are pretty consistent. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h33m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h33m9s">You don't have a lot of crazy things. What they do have is advantage and disadvantage. If an experience or a circumstance in the game puts you in an advantageous position, you get to roll two d20s and drop the lowest, so you get the higher of the two rolls. If you have disadvantage, you have to roll 2d20 and drop the highest, which is rough. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h33m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h33m9s">So that's a really simplified way of kind of playing spells to give you the advantage or get enemies disadvantage in that circumstance, which is great. Another big thing to consider for Fifth Edition is, and you guys went over it a little bit, backgrounds. Not necessary. Players that are new to the game might find it very interesting, but when you ask about your character's background and what they've done, where they come from, and how that builds them as a character, you can completely come up with whatever you want to. You can say they came from this background, they did these things, and this is all in my head in how I plan the character. Some people either are having a little bit of writer's block with their character or they don't know where to start or they just don't have a lot of experience, there's a great section in the new Player's Handbook about backgrounds, which you get to choose where your character comes from, where they grew up. They could be a folk hero, they can be a charlatan, they can be an acolyte, they can be a soldier from a war long past. They can be an entertainer, and that gives them bonus proficiencies in their skills that pertain to their background, and it gives you examples of certain personality traits that you can choose or randomly roll from. For example, go to the background section of the Player's Handbook over here, you can find-- where is it? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h33m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l1h36m50s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h36m50s">I'll go first. Some of my favorite characters that I've played with have all been people who decided what they wanted to be first and then picked a race and a class around what they wanted to be, so our good friend Paradox really wanted to be, like a roadie who-- (laughter) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h36m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h37m8s">He wanted to be a roadie, essentially like a traveling circus, who was like the curtain guy for all these bands and so he made a monk who had these ropes and he had a whip and all of his abilities he would grapple people and tie people up with his ropes, and that was like what he based, he had an idea first and then built a character around. So, 'cause the system is so flexible, you can-- it'll allow you to be pretty much anything you want to be. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h37m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h37m34s">So, one of the things I like, in Pathfinder there's like, you can make a geisha dancer who did damage with fans, so you can pretty much be whatever and then figure it out from there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h37m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h37m45s">You can build it. We made the gunslinger off Pathfinder here for that, so like, it's totally open and the backgrounds are a great way. They have a whole section for personality traits and you can roll for a personality trait, or multiple, and ideals. So things that really drive your character in their life. Bonds: things that really hold them, you know, via loyalty or to an ideal beyond that. And then flaws, which I love. Like right here I rolled a two as a sailor. "I'd say anything to avoid having to do extra work." That's a great flaw for a sailor. Probably not great for his work ethic, but you know. But those are really useful things, the backgrounds is a really cool addition for those who want a jumping point for building their characters' personality. Ah, let's answer a few questions in the chat while we're going about this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h37m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l1h38m31s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN, MARISHA, MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h38m31s">Very carefully. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h38m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h38m34s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h38m34s">The Dungeon Master Guide actually has a really good breakdown about, in the magical items section, about the cost and rarity of magical items. I'm just going to pull it up here real fast. There's common. Common magical items cost between 50 to 100 gold pieces. And it says "character level: first or higher". Uncommon, also first or higher, but around 100 to 500 gold pieces. Rare magical items are from fifth level or higher, around 500 to 5,000 gold pieces. Then very rare, and then legendary which get higher and higher from there. Legendary being 50,000 gold pieces and more. And so that helps you kinda gauge how easy or hard it is for players to find something of that level, and each one of the magical items in the book tells you if it's rare, uncommon, any of those type of circumstances. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h38m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h38m34s">However, it gives you a range, so you as the GM or DM, you decide based on how powerful the item is, how much it's worth if the players wanted to sell it or buy it, and generally you consider if players are selling magical items, they're selling lower than they would buy it from, like any sort of pawn shop-type thing, they might get a quarter of what it's worth at a store, but if they're really charismatic and they're really good with their persuasion rolls they might be able to get more money than that, or conversely lower the price of items they want to buy. So, you wanna make sure you don't want to give too out too many items throughout the campaign quickly because then the players either get too powerful, and then any items you give them down the road seem not as interesting or flippant. I like to run a campaign that has, you know, occasional upgrades, just a little slow trickle with bursts of good item use, that way when you, they do find something truly magical, it's a, "Aw, nice!" as opposed to, "Oh, "it's another boots, who wants the boots? That's-- I've already got like three, here, you have that." You know. It becomes less interesting and less special to me, so I like to trickle them out and keeping tabs on what players have, what they're missing, and then eventually kind of incorporate aspects of what they can upgrade their characters with down the road. Or they can create them for themselves. There are rules for creating magical items if they have an arcane practice to their class. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h38m34s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h40m53s">Everyone's backgrounds you see in the opening videos, they wrote themselves, and then I take those and I incorporate that into the world that I'm creating.

Some of them will just be breezing through encounters, some of them will actually find moments in the story that will directly be part of their personal goals, that will, we shall see. I like the players to incorporate aspects of their history, but beyond that, I don't want them to flesh out too much of their current or future aspects of the world because to them that takes out some of the mystery. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h40m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h45m11s">Skyfalls1 asks a specific about Trinket. I'm just gonna generalize the question. How do you handle player-controlled allies and their level progression? Are they part of the character who controls that ally, such as Trinket being the bear, a familiar or something. Or do they have their own independent leveling guide? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h45m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h45m31s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h45m31s">For this system, and it's different from system to system, in this system, that companion Trinket is part of the ranger class, the beastmaster that Laura went into, and Trinket's progression is tied towards her progression. As her level gets higher, Trinket will have more hit points, Trinket will gain better bonuses to his attacks as her proficiency bonus gets higher. So Trinket will advance pretty much alongside Vax-- or Vex. You're not wearing your shirt. Shh. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h45m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

There might be serious ramifications for failure, but god damn if you won't be talking about it for the next two or three, ten years, for the one time that you did this and it failed and your character got smashed in this horrible way, and two years after, your party would clamor to the gods your lost character's name whenever they charged into battle against a great foe.

<dd id="l1h51m58s">First one, I can't remember who's asking it, but I've seen it a couple times. They're asking about DM player characters. Your opinion on DM PCs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h51m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h52m6s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h52m6s">DM PCs, if they're a very good DM, can be fine. I, honestly, the main reason I became a DM was because my first DM had a PC who then somehow got all the best loot, and was a paladin in Second Edition but also somehow had the samurai kit, which I don't know if that can be a paladin, so he was dual-wielding magical katanas, and whenever an upgrade came up that he randomly rolled on the table, he went, "Oh, cool, I'm taking that." Dude, I don't even have a magical weapon. He's like, "I'll fight you for it." I'm like, oh, good paladin, fuck this shit, I'll make my own game. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h52m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h52m46s">But I think if it's a good DM you can, but the problem is, as a Dungeon Master, you know behind the scenes, you know where it's going, you know what's coming, you know what you're gonna fight, you know what to prepare for, you know what's gonna drop, you know so much that having a player character almost defeats the purpose. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h52m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l1h53m32s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h53m32s">I think that's totally fine if the players agree upon it.

"I want my table to be more immersed in the story, like instead of saying to me, 'So I "'tell them to go west.' Are there any tips on stimulating people?"

<dd id="l1h54m50s">Let me clarify. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h54m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h54m53s">Some people don't have the comfort level or have the social confidence to be able to jump straight into character. And so for them, it's more comfortable to play it that way, where they can remove themselves from the character and control them almost like a video game and say what they're doing as opposed to actually performing and acting it out. And there's nothing wrong with that. If anything, that's almost a baby-step version of them eventually becoming comfortable with fully immersing themselves in the character. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h54m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h54m53s">So I don't think that you should be down on somebody who plays that way necessarily. If you want to immerse them more as a DM, it's an invitation. You mention to the players, guys, going forward, I would love for us to be a little more into the circumstance. If you're feeling comfortable, please feel free to speak in character, or sometimes, if they're down for it but they have a hard time committing, put the law down. Anything you say in this game is in character if it's conversational. To where if they turn to somebody on the side and be like, "I can't believe you stabbed them in the back," be like, "I'm sorry, what did you say?" And then you start treating everything as character conversation, then they are put into a circumstance where they have to treat it like that. It may not be comfortable at first, but just like getting into the very, very cold water in a pool, at first it sucks, but over time they get used to it and they don't realize that they're there anymore after a while, you know, it just becomes natural. But for you as a Dungeon Master, you really have to, it's an invitation, a comfortable invitation, please come with me on this, I'd love to have you be more involved in this, and it's your job as the Dungeon Master to also bring your NPCs to life in the way you want them to roleplay, and when you ask them a question, don't ask it out to the whole group, pick somebody in the group that NPC's looking to and go, "You! What are you doing in my tavern?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h54m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h57m47s">Can't you also use, I'm DMing for my eight-year-old son and these kids, I haven't done this yet, but the DM book talks about rewarding them with inspiration dice, so can't you like, as a carrot, just start, anytime anyone shows even just the barest glimpse of roleplaying like that, go boom, inspiration dice to you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h57m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l1h58m6s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l1h58m6s">Yep, yes. I mentioned that a little earlier, and I'll expand upon that. On top of making sure people get bonuses and little bumps for cool experience moments, if someone does something really cool in character, you as the DM can reward them a d6 as an inspiration dice. An inspiration dice-- and they can only carry one at any given time-- but at some point later in the game, if they have to make a d20 roll, like an attack or a saving throw or a skill check, they can add the d6 to their final number to give them that extra little hero push towards succeeding at something. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h58m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h59m40s">I saw one good question I wanted to address. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h59m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h59m40s">Someone asked, suggestions on running a complex system for a bunch of new players? Which is a challenge, even sometimes in our game still. But it's one of those circumstances where you have to be patient. And honestly, you can simplify the rules. When I say you can customize anything in this book, you can leave out a lot of the rules and just keep it very simple. If you don't want to have, if you think a movement, an action, and a bonus action's too much? Get rid of the bonus action and just consider things, find another way to work it in. Or if you want to keep it a little more free-form and just keep it open to-- it puts a little more work on you as the DM to do so, so you have to rationalize what they're doing so it doesn't seem so broken, but you can just minimize a lot of the rules, you can cut out half the skills if you don't think they're necessary. You can get rid of feats, you can get rid of backgrounds. You can halve the spell lists, if you want. If you want to narrow it down, you can go through and trim and trim and trim until you think you have a nice, simpler system for everyone to start with, and then you can start rolling out the more expanded aspects of the system. So don't feel like you have to verbatim hand everyone this book and be, read it all, let's go! You can go ahead and pick the few rules you think are important to play the game, teach them to your group and just start with those, and then slowly as time goes on let them research and discover more as they go on. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=1h59m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l2h1m5s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l2h1m5s">To what you're saying, too, what Matthew, I don't how to say this. What Matthew allows me to do is, for all you casters out there, if the spell isn't in the book, ask your DM if you can craft them. I've-- Matthew has-- if it doesn't exist, he's let me make spells. That's what Glacial Blast is, it doesn't exist here but I was like, hey, I wanna do this thing that doesn't quite, isn't described in here, so you can ask your DM and he can figure it out with you. I of course always give him way-too-OP stuff, he's like no, and then he gives me an actual spell. It works. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=2h1m5s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l2h1m41s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l2h1m41s">And the players, as they submit custom things, they have to understand that you do your best to balance it, and if they try it out a few times and it's still kind of overbalanced, it might be scaled back a bit, 'cause you're still trying to find what works and you can't really tell how balanced something is until you try it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=2h1m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h1m41s">But that's kind of the relationship you establish with your DM if you want to customize and create things on your own, is like, can I do this? Sure, but make it like this. Okay, let's try that. Play a few games. Yeah, it's a little powerful, we're gonna scale this back a little bit, and don't be like, come on! You said it was okay!

<dd id="l2h2m11s">Also, earlier, talking about customizing monsters for the encounter.

I became bored with my homeland after impregnating all of the impregnable and decided to pledge my loyalty to the overlord of a faraway land and set off to do his evil bidding. I'm not really evil, though, the overlord himself asked me to do a lot of very evil things. At least, that's what the voices tell me.

<dd id="l2h6m44s">Upon your chance meeting one evening in a darkened, drunken tavern in a darkened, drunken state, upon spinning tales of your backgrounds, your ears perked up at the promise of not only great riches, but great soulful, gratifying angelic entities promised to you from the realm beyond, this Overlord, this Overlord that keeps a very, very carefully hidden temple of worship not too far from this city, no more than two and a half days' travel on horseback. You mention to them that there is a place, a grand place where this temple could be found, and deep within resided the secret of contacting and being taken into the riches, the eternal vault of what is the Overlord. Upon this agreement, a small bit of change was exchanged, you managed to finagle the local stable out of a couple horses and found your way traveling before daybreak. You ride and ride and ride for the next two days. An awkward series of camping circumstances allow you to find you don't have a lot in common based on conversation, other than the love of money, and the love of this promise they give you. And the further you travel, the more and more the baneful eye of mistrust begins to fall upon one Snugglelord. As the beads of sweat drip down your face, but you know the city is mounting soon, there will be a time where you can prove to them that, in some way, shape, or form, they have helped you find what it is you're seeking and you can possibly kill them before they have the chance to take you out. Nevertheless. As the second sunrise hits, you crest over the last of a large, hilly landscape, the high grass brushing past your boots as you push through these grasslands, and you see upon the fabled city of Rockmarr. Rockmarr, not really that fabled, it's a small farming village, he seems to be talking it up as this grand city. So there's a moment of disappointment as you look over and see what may be anywhere from 60 to 70 houses to hovels to a slightly dilapidated farmland. Bit of confusion hits you and you look over to Snugglelord as he puts his hands up. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=2h6m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h10m31s">As the tides of your relationships quickly seem to turn, as you head towards the town, you notice-- and you've traveled here once before and (laughs) while you understand that secretly, beneath where this hidden chat room is, is a cache of money that your previous employer hid amongst other riches, and probably murdered most of your allies before you managed to escape from his clutches, and probably the only person of your band of roving thieves and miscreants to not fall to the Shadowed Blade, you know that his riches are held there, you know that there are a number of traps set within this dark underpassing, and you know that once you can just get there, safely, you can probably make it out alone. So just hold tight to your position and you should be fine. As you ride up to the outskirts of town, you can't help but notice that, strangely, what was once a bustling farming town seems fairly empty. The nearby grass seems to have turned from a brightish healthy green to a dull, crackled brown-grey. The farms themselves, the lands have turned dark and cracked. The landscape appears to have been untended-to for many a month, and aside from a couple of scratching sounds and a distant cawing of crows overhead as they flutter off into the distance, there doesn't seem to be much of a sign of life in this village. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=2h10m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you ride in slowly, the clomping of your horses hitting against the rock, and dried dirt beneath your feet, you catch what looks to be a handful of individuals gathered towards the center of town. Maybe no more than 150 feet away, you see four figures, all different heights, dressed in ragged rags and clothes that seem to have been met with some sort of hardship and long, long nights without any sort of cleaning agent.

You glance over, and currently you can only see a few feet into the darkened well, and it's too dark for you to see anything beneath. However, you are, as you are a dwarf, you have dark vision, and in the low-light circumstance from the noonday sun, you are able to look down and see that the brackish liquid, what would be a normal watery well, instead is very thick and viscous in the way it slowly moves.

<dd id="l2h47m24s">All right. So as you step up to what looks like the little bit of this stone outcropping that's slowly peering out of the earth, it looks like this is the upper corner of a stone chamber that has crumbled in a little bit, and you're now peering into it from an elevated position outside of the chamber. Looking at the structure of the stone, the way it's built and carved and wedged together to form the almost brick-like pattern of its making, it's definitely not dwarven in make, but it looks very old, and it looks like the material itself is almost like a sandstone, and a lot of civilizations that long existed before proper stonecutting could be used, where stone could be moved from nearby mountains or even the dwarven stonecutting techniques were spread across this land, this was a very primitive way of building subterranean structures. You gather this interior is probably very, very old, well over a thousand years. And as you peer down into it using the torchlight, you can see down within the chamber, it's rectangular in shape, there appears to be a trough with some sort of liquid that is in an ovoid shape around a raised platform in the center, and in the center of this platform, on top of it, you can see a very, very dull blue glow from this crystalline spherical orb that is resting on it and is giving off this very, very faint blue light. And the further you walk towards it as you inspect the interior from the top of the hole in this stone structure, you hear that musical ringing sound get louder and louder as you step towards it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=2h47m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

On the outskirts of that water, on those positions, those four corners, the runes are deeper-carved into the stone and seem to almost have a quartz-like texture to them, almost like there was something quartz set into the stone floor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=2h49m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As the stones tumble off of its torso, and its shoulder area, it hits the ground and they just turn to dust upon impact with the ground. You can see now, within the sandstone in the center, there is kind of a crackling arcane energy, almost like a spider-like electricity that is holding its form together that is the same color as the stone in the center of the room.

<dd id="l3h8m45s">24. As you clutch the orb, you can feel for a moment the electrical energy surging through your forearms and into your body, and for a second your muscles tense and you feel like your physical form is being slowed down, but you shrug it off for a second as you're clutching it in your hands right now. You're looking at it, you've pulled it off of the pedestal. As you pull it off the pedestal, it leaves a couple trails of sparks off the top that stretch out between the pedestal and where you're pulling the orb off. You look back and the entity currently is looking like it's slowing in its physical ability to move around when it's in your grasp, but it's still turning around towards you, kind of looking, noticing that you've now grabbed something that is inherently connected to its physicality. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=3h8m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>

It doesn't break, but a big solid crack suddenly spiders through the entire interior of the orb, as it rolls off and into the liquid on the outskirts. You can see the electrical center in the center of the sandstone golem flicker and flash with light, and you see one of its arms hits the ground behind it and scatters into dust and sand. It's still keeping its form together, and it's kind of lurching towards you with its other arm rearing back for some sort of an attack, but it looks like it's having a really hard time holding itself together.

Also, there's usually the people sitting here that are fucking professionals, so there is a slight bar that's really, really high, like, a little intimidation there. The roleplaying part's really fun. What I'm intimidated by is just, this is a lot of stuff, this is a lot of information and it's a lot to learn, I'm excited to learn, and I want to know what all this stuff is, because I don't want to feel like a dumdum, and I feel kinda like a dumdum.

<dd id="l3h33m7s">So through that, our, we had this warlock or wizard who summoned this infernal mastiff to ride, and he was talking all this shit, so I rolled and punched his mastiff, and since it was a spell, I punched it out of existence, and that's when the archivist came to, and he was like, he just sees me punch it, and I kept saying we are good people, because I realized that I'm neutral good, so I didn't want to torture him. And then that's when the DM was like, just so you know, he came to, you punched a devilish mastiff out of existence, and yelled, "We're good people!" over and over to him. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=P8EcS0WYbuc&t=3h33m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
