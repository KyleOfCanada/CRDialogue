<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone! Welcome to Critical Role. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">After a two-week hiatus of our usual gaming schedule at Comic Con and then a fun-filled crazy week with half the party playing games and having fun while me and Marisha were in New Zealand, we're happy to be back. We're happy you guys are here as we continue our adventure going forward. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">We'll have a lot of really cool things to announce here in a moment, but let's go ahead and get that intro video started. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">[dramatic music] <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m31s">Welcome back. All right, this is Critical Role: a show where a bunch of voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. Fun crazy nerds rolling dice and good times. With the adventures of Vox Machina. You're doing all right Travis. Couple quick things: Me and Marisha wanted to say a quick shout out to all of our Critters who came to visit us in Wellington, New Zealand at Armageddon Expo. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h1m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m31s">We had a strong showing of Critters that was really amazing from across the world. And Australia. People could fly over from Australia just to get us to sign their books, so there's a lot of really awesome fan love out there. So you guys are great. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h1m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m9s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m9s">Maybe next time all of us could go? You guys should tell them. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h2m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m13s">Oh man, a Down Under Kiwi trip for all Critical Role would be a lot of fun. Send your local-- I guess you don't have a congressman, because you're a different country. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h2m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m22s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m22s">Your "Con-gressman." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h2m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m24s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m24s">Oh there you go. Orion saved it. Thank you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h2m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m26s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m26s">It was there the whole time, Matt. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h2m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m26s">(laughter) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h2m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h2m30s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m30s">Disadvantage. All right, so first and foremost, couple things I want to get up here. We had our sub giveaways this evening. For every 50 subs, we give away a signed player's handbook by the cast of Critical Role, a signed photo of the cast. And tonight especially we're also giving away in that package Espionage nail packs, specifically with our fantastic gamer dice on the tips. Espionage Cosmetics were gracious to give these to us, and we will give them to you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h2m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m30s">Every 50 subs. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h2m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m0s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m0s">Awesome. Go follow them on Twitter; I think they're @espionagemakeup. Just look it up. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h3m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m0s">They're awesome. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h3m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m9s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m9s">Google it. However, we already have a winner, before the show started. That's explodingiggy. So congratulations to explodingiggy. You already got one more to come. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h3m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m9s">The fun and interesting challenge for this evening as we've been made aware, you guys, being the ridiculously amazing people you are. One of you crafted a challenge for yourself. That if we can manage to somehow get to 5,000 subscribers before the end of the show tonight, they will create and send an eight-foot Trinket. Like eight-foot-tall Trinket bear. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h3m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m45s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m45s">Yeah which is vague. A little. What's it made out of? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h3m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m49s">#</a> <strong>ZAC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m49s">It's a teddy bear. It's a giant teddy bear. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h3m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m52s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m52s">And maybe his little paws can be on my shoulder the whole time I play? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h3m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m56s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h3m56s">Oh, he would be a perpetual staple of the set. That would be behind you at all times. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h3m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m1s">#</a> <strong>ZAC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m1s">Cool, not difficult at all, guys! Totally not difficult at all! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m4s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m4s">Yes, but we have to get to 5,000 subscribers. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m7s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m7s">Trojan horse and a suit that they wear. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h4m7s">They could sneak themselves onto the stage that way. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m13s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m13s">I'll get inside the teddy bear, and I'll act out Trinket during the game. Perfect. That's not going to happen. It might happen. That's if we hit 5000 subscribers, so all your friends you know that watch the show who don't subscribe yet, tell them to. If you know anyone that hasn't seen the show yet, get them on, because a giant eight-foot bear would be pretty much the most ridiculous thing ever. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m13s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m33s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m33s">Yeah, I already tweeted #8ftTrinket. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m36s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m36s">I saw something subs for bears. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m41s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m41s">Nope. Bad idea. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h4m45s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h4m45s">(laughs) Yeah, subs for bears is a whole section of Craigslist you don't want to go to. Or you do, if that's your thing. All right, so. Happy to be back from Comic Con. We had a great panel and great turnout there. Thank you for those who came and those who watched the panel. If you haven't seen it yet, the panel is available on the Geek and Sundry website. You can watch it. And as we all know, last episode we said goodbye temporarily to our fantastic gnome cleric, Pike. She's off in New York shooting awesome television shows, but she's here in spirit. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h4m45s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m18s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m18s">It's going to be great. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h5m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m19s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m19s">It's going to be a good show. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h5m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m21s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m21s">Also, as a reminder, our charity that we run here for the show is to 826LA. 826LA is a fantastic charity that promotes and teaches creative writing to younger kids between the ages of 8 and 16, I think it was. Somewhere in that range? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h5m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m40s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m40s">K through High School. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h5m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m41s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m41s">K through High School. Fantastic program, and anything you can do to help is much appreciated and awesome. And, Marisha, if you want to go ahead and take this away. We have a new addition to our set coming next week. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h5m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m55s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m55s">It's so awesome! I had the absolute pleasure of joining Felicia on the latest episode of The Flog. Go check it out. It's back. I love that show. She wanted to make a neon sign, and she was like, "Let's do a Critical Role sign." Because she's a fan of our show, which is awesome. She's probably watching right now. Love you, Felicia. So this was it, unfortunately. Yes, are we ready to do the honors? Ready? For Vox Machina! (cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h5m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h6m32s">So yeah, that's probably going to be up on our set next week, blessing us with its rose-colored glow. Go watch, if you want to see how we made it. We got this awesome tutorial. It's cool. You can go and learn how to make neon signs yourself. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h6m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m51s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m51s">And it's all science-y too. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h6m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h6m52s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h6m52s">It's all science-y. It's totally nerdy awesome. Yeah, krypton. But yes. Here we go. All right, say bye-bye to the sign for now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h6m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m7s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m7s">It'll be back. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m9s">#</a> <strong>ZAC</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m9s">Hey, Matt. We already have another 50 winner. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m9s">(laughter) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m12s">It was SonicaMoto. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m14s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m14s">SonicaMoto is our new winner, already. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m14s">Congratulations, SonicaMoto. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m14s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m19s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m19s">We need less than 300 subs for that bear. I think we can do that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m19s">I think that's pretty likely. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m19s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m26s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m27s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m32s">#</a> <strong>MARISHA</strong></dt>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m36s">#</a> <strong>TALIESIN</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m36s">Encourage this. Oh no, encourage this. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m36s">(laughs) I encourage bear. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m41s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m41s">(laughing) I do encourage... Nope. Okay. I am a trained comedian. That is not a thing. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m41s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h7m54s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h7m54s">Last but not least, before we get started, we do have one guest in the studio who's been watching for a bit tonight. Our good friend, Joré is over here from quite a distance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m54s">We met him at Comic Con. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h7m54s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h9m32s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h9m32s">They've been really amazing. I know many of you have asked about what's the backstory to Vox Machina? What's that history before the stream started? We're working on something. It may take a little bit, but one or more of those artists may be involved. But when we do have that available to you, it should be really cool, and I hope you'll enjoy it. Anyway. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h9m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h9m49s">Oh, also, since this is fantasy, I'd like to announce that my show went pretty well that's on Mondays, 7-10 on this channel. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h9m49s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h10m1s">#</a> <strong>ORION</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h10m1s">Ooh, I'm glad you asked, Taliesin. It is me and Jessica Merizan playing Final Fantasy XIV. We just found each other in the same world. There's a free company we're going to start.

I'm happy to say that Taliesin, man, Thancred is still in this version of Final Fantasy XIV, so you can check his work out too, and he's awesome. The funny thing is I didn't know your character was like a badass. So I was listening to him and I was like "Oh fuck". <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h10m1s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h13m20s">Yeah, so let's actually start this game, guys. Thank you for being patient with our intro here. We've been gone for two weeks. We have a lot to talk about, so thank you for letting us get that out. So picking up where we left off, the party completed the venture of taking the horn of Orcus to a place of safety and sealing it away, hopefully for eternity, with the help of Lady Kima, to the scalebearers. After heading to the basement of the Platinum Sanctuary in the city of Vasselheim, they've succeeded to do so. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h13m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h13m20s">Vasselheim, which is a distant city to the far northwest of the continent they're used to. This city is a very devout, religion-based city, and currently considered the oldest bastion of civilization in the known civilized world. After taking a skyship across the ocean to get there, sealing the Horn, you guys also discover upon doing so that the ruins, long-forgotten ruins, of what appears to be an ancient temple to Sarenrae were recently discovered. While Sarenrae does not have a strong following in this city, the few that are trying to raise it ask for Pike's help to stay back and help build it and bring it to its former glory. Hopefully to re-establish a basis of worship in this city, and she decided to help these folks. The party then steps away from the ruins of the tower, sad but understanding of the circumstance. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h13m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h14m53s">Critical Role all of a sudden becomes the greatest grass-watching game of all time. As you all stand there, you have to decide your next course of action. You stand in the muddy road, taking in the cold dusk air as the sun slowly sets to the west. Now, this area of the city has a vastly different feel than the Platinum Sanctuary. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h14m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h14m53s">In the haste to make it to the ruin, you've passed out of the section that seems to be under Bahamut's watch and into a different area. In this area, most of the buildings are reinforced with ruddy iron plates. Plumes of smoke rise up from a handful of heavy smokestacks. You can see over the rooftops in the distance toward the center of this section what looks like a massive dark red statue of a muscular bearded man. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h14m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h21m48s">Yeah. You get the sense that this area, most of the people that live in this area are more rough-and-tumble than the already-rough people who live in Vasselheim, from what you've encountered. The buildings themselves all seem to be reinforced with iron plates and it looks like there is a very heavy trade in metalwork, and a lot of the construction of anything metallic appears to be coming through or from this portion of the town. As you approach closer to this statue, it's not just a statue. You see it is actually sitting atop what looks to be a large, blocky fortress-like temple. Unlike the Platinum Sanctuary, which is a very beautiful but simple array, this one has a crenellated top to each of these walled structures. You can see braziers blasting flame every 20 or so feet along the top of it. You can see, as you approach the front of this, there are two giant stone doorways with steps that look up to it and what looks to be two gargantuan war horns that spiral along the sides and then open up outward towards the entire city in front of it. I'm going to ask you guys to make a religion check, if you could. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=0h21m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The beard is long and goes to about mid-chest. He carries in one hand this long, thick shortsword and has furs and leathers about his legs and midsection.

You can see the other bookie, who is dressed similarly in the purplish robes you saw before, also begins to heal our good fighting half-orc friend as he lumps over and takes his sack of coins from him. The clerics of Kord are the ones actually running this, it looks like. You come to in the pit, Grog, beaten, wearied, and fatigued because of your frenzied rage.

<dd id="l1h25m39s">He's definitely not a challenge for Overlord status, that's for sure. Guys, so in case you're wondering what all of this 5k hype is that you keep seeing, if you're watching from home and you tuned in after we started. Megiyama in the chatroom has challenged you guys, the audience, if we get up to 5,000 subscribers tonight, he will buy a very large, and by very large I mean eight feet tall. It is massive. He sent me a picture; it is massive, I don't know where we will put it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h25m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h25m39s">We'll figure it out somehow. He will buy that for us and ship it to us, it's a very, very generous thing to help get us to 5,000 subscribers, and I was told from some people in the chat that I should also contribute in some way, shape, or form, so I have agreed to dress up as Pengulord tomorrow all day if we reach this goal. And for those who don't know, there was a very large war this morning in team No Stream, the chatroom, while we were offline. Someone thought it would be funny to put my face on a penguin. I did not think it was funny, and I timed out and banned every single person that referenced it, and exalted all of my power as Overlord, so it pains me to agree to do this, very much so, because it completely diminishes everything I've strived so hard for in world domination. Penguins are the least-threatening animals on the planet, and I despise them. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h25m39s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h29m36s">Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale!

<dd id="l1h29m36s">In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h29m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h29m36s">But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life.

<dd id="l1h31m22s">A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h31m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h31m22s">Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h31m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h33m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h34m40s">Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h34m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h34m40s">Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h34m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h34m40s">As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h34m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h34m40s">She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h34m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h34m40s">When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h34m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h36m43s">Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h36m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h36m43s">A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h36m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h36m43s">Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h36m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h36m43s">A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h36m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h36m43s">Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third.

<dd id="l1h38m6s">Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h38m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h38m6s">From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h38m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h38m6s">However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h38m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h38m6s">After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h38m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h38m6s">I found those answers to be unacceptable. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h38m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h38m6s">A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h38m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h38m6s">Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=1h38m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h3m58s">Good to know. This forest, incredibly lush, presses up against the city walls itself, nearly oppressively with the impact. It grows up right against the city wall. And it's almost like the wall itself is constantly keeping it at bay in the way that the growth that's pushing inward. The tree trunks you see, now that you've hit the interior, vary in size, some only a few feet in diameter. You come across a couple that are 20, 30 feet or more, giant trees. Also, even though it's midday at this point in time, the light into the forest is choked so thin it's almost like it's dusk, near dark, inside the forest. The air hits you with the smell of wet earth, moss. Vines and branches dangle from and reach from every direction, and you can see there are, you can walk through the path here, but nearing trees themselves, the roots are so large and so twisted where they enter the ground. You're definitely going to have to keep up with your ranger friend here. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=2h3m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h5m16s">All right. Following its path, you see that there are tracks going both ways, meaning the creature as it came through towards the city, it turned its path about and then exited the same pathway. So as you're following it along for a good 15 minutes or so, you come across a small opening in the forest where you can see what looks to be a very messily partially devoured carcass of something. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=2h5m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

The heads are now caught on fire. As you take the second Fireball, you set it off, shouting that outward. You use Control Flame at the same time as the Telekinesis you're still maintaining to envelop the explosion of the Fireball and contain it in the center. You slam it and let it detonate as part of the impact into the torso, where the heads are currently attached. You end up blowing half the heads off the hydra in the process. The rest of its body's trying to keep itself standing up. However, the explosion itself sent the stone wall around you guys broken into pieces and shards now sticking upward. The hydra backs up and falls onto its side, impaling itself on the shattered stone wall that you had kept up as it slowly slides down on the wound and gurgles out its last life breath, the rest of its body on fire, slowly sinking to the base of the stone wall. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=3h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h11m25s">Eventually make your way back to town, skirt around the outer wall to one of the three main gates, this one right on the outskirts of the Braving (stutters). Too many creatures. Braving Grounds. The gates open. You're all led in, first question at the sight of you guys, but Aldor raises his hand and says, "No, they're with us; it's fine." You all walk in, leads you to the outskirts of the Braving Grounds to a new area of the town you have yet to travel to. At which point, he introduces, "Welcome to the Quad Roads. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=3h11m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h11m25s">This is where the Slayer's Take makes its place. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=3h11m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h11m25s">"This is also where the Erathis's Crown is. Best you pay an homage to the "deity of civilization while here." He pulls out a small gem around his neck with a small symbol on it, kisses it, and puts it back in his shirt. You guys continue walking to what is now, you can see these large roads that streak across. You've seen them join with the other sections. This is the most central of all the various districts of the city of Vasselheim. There is a very large trade bazaar structure not that far out of the main gate that leads to the center of this district. You can see barkers shouting out left and right to you, various phrases dealing with food and various crops, and creature fresh meat. "Fresh meat out of the Abundance! Takers of the Abundance!" And people yelling out for general goods, packs, leathers, large carts being wheeled past you, until eventually you make your way to what looks like a very old, dark-wood lodge, about three stories high, decorated with dozens of tusks and claws and other trophies that look as old as the building itself. A carved wooden sign stands bolted to the top of the porch that says "Slayer's Take Guildhall" in the common tongue. Approaching the door, still that awkward quiet keeping over the group, there is an engraving into the doorway-- it's pushed into the wood-- that reads, "Here is where the hunters gather, keen eyes and "blades at ready. We cease the unknown's cackling laughter. Our will is strong, our members plenty. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=3h11m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h11m25s">"We stand against the tide of darkness. We do the deeds few men can handle. Reap forth a trophy from "the carcass. We are your strength, we are your candle." Aldor does a knock on the door. The door opens, an eye looks through, and the door swiftly opens as another individual who's dressed in a makeshift leather and hide armor steps aside. You're all let in, carrying the large hydra heads through that have been gathering looks from the individuals watching you charge through the streets. To the center of the room, you see what looks to be amongst the loose cast-iron candelabras that are affixed to the rafters, small candles flicker for the interior light, you see a long desk where a halfling male of muscular build sits eagerly rubbing his hands together, his harsh features and light scars dotting his face and hands, his red hair showing tinges of grey. His shifting smile belies a youthful vigor as you approach with the trophies. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=3h11m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h11m25s">"Aldor! Welcome back. How goes that bleeding mess-headed beast? "I see you seem to have dropped it before you." Aldor takes the first head that he's carrying and chucks it to the ground. As it rolls across with two large thuds, the rest of the congealed liquid seeping into the wood. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=3h11m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h11m25s">"Aye, that's true, but we bring a bit of an obstruction in the way." Glances to the rest of you. "Obstruction, you say. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=3h11m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

She would like to talk to you." As you guys all step inside, the interior, a soft, glowing magical torch lights the room from the ceiling. The entire room is a large office or study. There are books and meticulously kept scrolls. At a glance, you can see they break down various creature types, that talk about indigenous bestial creatures, some talk about the anatomy of mythical and mystical beasts. This is a research facility for the hunting of any such creature that would find its way near or in the vicinity of Vasselheim. There, waiting for you, not at her desk, but leaning against it, with her hands also at her back, similar to her husband, you see before you in very finely crafted dark brown and black studded leather armor, a small shoulder cloak fixed and tossed over one shoulder, tousled short brown hair, deep purple skin. The second tiefling you've seen today. This woman stands with bright white eyes, no pupil. Her tongue flickers out of her mouth like a snake a little bit as you enter. And she looks about the rest of the party. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QDdT5UqGaDw&t=3h18m37s">&rarr;</a></dd>
