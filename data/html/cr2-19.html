<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role where a bunch of us nerdy ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Before we dive into tonight's game, we got some announcements to get through. First and foremost, we have two fantastic sponsors tonight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">The first of which is our good friend D&amp;D Beyond! They've been with us since we began this campaign. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h0m0s">The new book, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, releases tomorrow. I got one last month and it's amazing. Oh my god, it's so good. It has the Astral Dreadnought, I'm so happy. Hope you guys never have to fight one. You can order that now on D&amp;D Beyond and check out the wonderful content there. If you order on D&amp;D Beyond, you also receive the Rrakkma Adventurers League gith-focused introductory adventure for free. If you know what that means, we're of like mind. The githyanki is such an amazing part of D&amp;D lore. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m53s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m53s">Go Yankees! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h0m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m55s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m55s">Go Razi! Anyway, as a reminder, Tome of Foes is also available in D&amp;D Beyond's legendary bundle, which is still 25% off using the code 826LA. If you want it to do the legendary bundle, get the huge discount, Tome of Foes is included in that, so go and check it out. It's amazing. Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, and hope you enjoy the new release tomorrow. Sam? You want to talk about our other sponsor for the evening? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h0m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m23s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m23s">Yes, our second sponsor for the evening is Backblaze! (cheering) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h1m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m29s">If you don't know Backblaze-- I'm sorry. If you guys don't know Backblaze, it is unlimited cloud backup for Macs and PCs for just $5 a month. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h1m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h1m29s">Yes, Backblaze stores docs, music, photos, videos, fanart, and more. I use the service, and to be honest, I always thought, "It sounds magical." Well guys, I've discovered that it is actual magic. Faery magic to be exact; In fact, I captured one of their head faeries, Yev, a little sprite named Yev, in this trash bag. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h1m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h2m33s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h2m33s">Shh. I've got a backup if it doesn't work. He says you can restore files anywhere via direct download, or restore by mail and receive a hard drive with your files. Yes, Yev, but how does Backblaze keeps all those backups for such a low price? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=0h2m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h10m4s">Apparently, going back full circle. Back at 255 and zero. Last we left off: The Mighty Nein have been caught up in the political turmoil of the Empire, noticing that the king has declared war on the eastern realm of Xhorhas, specifically the Kryn dynasty. There was an assault on one of the garrisons in the east. There were many lives lost and the sky now darkens. You've begun to decide what it is you can do and what your current plan of action is. As you began to gather your things as you decide where your next trajectory would be, you were summoned to the King's Hall, and brought before the Lawmaster of the town of Zadash.

<dd id="l0h38m5s">"Understood. That underground tunnel, that you've already visited, happens to be a major "artery for our smuggling business, leading straight up to the Lebenda Swamp.

We've been rather worried that no shipments have made their "way south by the river in weeks. After sending your friend up to Berleben last week, it was "discovered that our safe house and storage facility in the swamp has gone dark. One of my "men, as well as a handful of theirs in Berleben, went to investigate and never returned.

<dd id="l1h13m29s">I enjoy it, and I'm sure every Dungeon Master out there who watches knows exactly how I feel when it happens. You gather your things up into the cart, the horses begin to push off and you make your way through the city streets of Zadash to the Northern Wall. You can still see some of the townsfolk coming out and going about their day, but the general air of tension and nervousness still holds court throughout the city's streets. There are clusters of crownsguard. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=1h13m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h13m29s">They're escorting the Righteous Brand to the eastern side. You make your way to the northern side of the city where the Signet Wall district begins where you have the large fortresses, where the military stays, and the barracks that surround that region. To the large gate that exits the building out into the rest of the Marrow Valley. As you make it through the large, raised portcullis, along with a few other folks that are in the process of making their own journey into the north or to the west or to the east, you step out onto the dirt road, into the green blowing fields, the cold breeze that's blowing beneath the graying skies of Wildemount and you push off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=1h13m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h13m29s">Being here for a while, it seems strange, but also welcoming to be back on the open road for a moment. You glance around and take a deep breath as that clean post-rain air still seems to linger in the vicinity. As you make a sweep on the horizon, with the rolling hills and patches of trees, catch your vision off to the far east on the outside of the Signet Wall district, you see hundreds if not thousands of soldiers, all gathered and making their way east in small troops. Here the mainstay source, the bulk of military power in the center of the Empire makes its way to war. You see horses, siege engines, and large ballista on wheels all being carried and prepared for the journey to the borders of Xhorhas and beyond. With that, you pick up and continue northward, making your way long the Amber Road, towards to where the Bromkiln Byway carves off to your destination. First, I want to ask you guys: what pace are you travelling at? You can go slow pace if you try to be super stealthy. Normal pace is fine. Fast pace you go quickly, but you threaten exhaustion if you continue to push that way. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=1h13m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h16m35s">You guys push forward and watch as, behind you, the large, looming walls and towers and buildings of Zadash that had been your home for weeks disappear slowly behind you. Once again, you're embraced by the wilds and open landscapes of the valley. You take a moment to reflect upon the insanity and craziness of the urban atmosphere and the peace, as well as the unknown, that comes with traversing such an open plain. I'd say you have maybe a few hours before the sun sets. Right as you hit the intersection between the Amber Road and the Bromkiln Byway, the sun has set. The sky is dark; the clouds prevent starlight from coming through, and what moonlight would be visible is choked, giving you only the faint glimmer of the moon's location behind the cloud cover. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=1h16m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

His head wreathed and tangled grey coarse hair, like a crown around the top of the head that goes past the mouth and over the chest to about mid-point there. A foot-long beard around his chin that ends at about the bottom of the clavicle, or the sternum. Muscular and hunched, his gray-green skin looks thick and weathered, and folded crow's nests under where the nose and the mouth is, the two heavy tusks protruding from underneath the lower jaw. His eyes are sunken and bloodshot, around the side of the yellow sclera. One hand opens the door, while another one remains out of sight.

He goes, "Come in," and opens the door fully and steps back. You can now see he had, in the other hand, a really nasty-looking, somewhat rusted battleaxe that he had right around the door, just in case. He goes and sets the loop of the handle of it and puts it over a knob that's in the wall and then steps inside his small hovel as you look in the inside. It's fairly bare, but there are lots of furs that have been skinned and cured that are up on the walls that are hanging, from wolves, from badgers, different other creatures that he's probably hunted and brought in here for the tanning process. You see, hanging on the edge, a handmade piece of hide armor that has been recently stained, and as soon as you get close you can smell the stained scent off of it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=1h45m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h40m9s">As you complete the final watch, the rain doesn't subside. The flashes of lightning and the rolling of thunder makes it a bit difficult, but the exhaustion of the previous battle manages to combat that enough for those of you who want to complete your evening's rest, you do. Until eventually the glow of the morning's light brings you all to consciousness once more. The rain reduces itself to a drizzle. You gather your materials, do the best you can to warm up, shaking yourself in the cold, damp morning. Gather your cart, slowly head back towards the roadway, and continue your journey towards the Labenda Swamp. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w6jE3T_ooKw&t=3h40m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
