<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, here, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h0m8s">No, I got it right this time. Careful what you wish for. But yeah, so thank you for joining us! Last week was kind of a crazy episode, and this week we continue that theme. However, I do want to go over some quick announcements, so we can get the show on the road, get as much game time as possible. Looks like we are going to be down one Scanlan Shorthalt tonight. Unfortunately, Sam Riegel had scheduling stuff he couldn't get around, but we do have our other fantastic gnome, Ashley Johnson, joining us from New York. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h0m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h3m31s">Oh, I voice directed on two games. They're the exact same game, basically. One is called 'The Witness.' Mastermind Jonathan Blow has created a very, very unique game. There's no shooting people in the face or any of that, but it looks to be one of the best gaming experiences of the year. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h3m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h5m17s">#</a> <strong>LIAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h5m17s">That code is 'critrole'. Critrole. You get free shipping if you type in 'critrole', but you got to do it on their website, not other websites. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h5m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h5m24s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

There's still a huge portion of our proceeds that go to 826LA every week and-- Well, they tutor children through the ages of kindergarten and 18, because kindergarten is an age, and help in creative writing and storytelling, and they also have cool store fronts all the way across the country.

<dd id="l0h7m40s">All right, guys, so welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role. So to get you up to speed real fast: the group Vox Machina, after finishing their foray in Whitestone, finding a member of the council, Riskel Daxio, was a cult member for this entity called Vecna, bringing him to justice and executing him in the throne room of the palace of Emon, they discovered during the search the traveling troupe of Dr. Dranzel's performance troupe, which Scanlan used to be a part of. During this time, they hatched a plan to have Vox Machina seek this house that had fallen into disarray, and the owner disappeared for a while, that may contain some goods. The party went and investigated. They had previously been in the house and were curious as to where it stands at this point in time, especially if more people are disappearing into it. Upon going into what was once General Krieg's house where they once fought a blue dragon, they discovered the corpse of Krieg, long-buried from the collapse of the cavern and picked apart by some other large clawed creature. And immediately got into some sort of a fight with a purple worm and a frost worm that were essentially battling over whatever it was that was moving in that tunnel that seemed to be nice and tasty. These adolescent worm creatures, not even fully grown, proved a nice little challenge, but the party managed to succeed in escaping after killing them, before the mother showed up. They returned to Emon, managed to help Scanlan's now-discovered daughter, Kaylie, out of a little pinch in getting imprisoned after she'd gotten into a major bar brawl. And the party returned to their keep, where they were notified that Uriel, the Sovereign of Tal'Dorei and the city state of Emon, had an announcement to make in the Cloudtop District. So gathered Gilmore, gathered the rest of the party, and everyone went to the Cloudtop District around noon at the presentational stage-- not at noon, at dusk. Sorry, the other one. So, at which point Uriel announced that he felt he was no longer a worthy leader or ruler of this entire realm he has under his watch and is deciding to step down. During this announcement, however, a number of strange entities came through the clouds in the sky as a series of chromatic ancient dragons swooped in and began to destroy the city of Emon. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h7m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m40s">Many of the townsfolk gathered at that square were immediately killed. The party as well as a few straggling survivors ran away as both the large, gargantuan black and green dragon begin to chase you down. Right before they honed in to pick you off, an even larger ancient red dragon shoved them off to head east to continue their plot after slamming down into the center of Emon and claiming it as his own domain. The party escaped via the druid's Transport Via Plants spell and just stepped through the tree to land in the center of their keep of Greyskull. So now we pick up where that left off. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h7m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h7m40s">So as you all come rushing through the other side of the transport spell, each one of you comes stumbling out into the center of the temple to Sarenrae that's constructed on the base floor of your keep. The sheer intensity and force that pushes you all through one after another, some of you end up tripping and catching yourself, but nevertheless you all make it through safe and sound before the large tree trunk behind you, the portal, snaps shut, the magic exhausted. The adrenaline still pumping in your head, you're all still thinking over and processing what exactly had just happened and what it means. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h7m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h16m59s">All right, good to know. All right, so as you go to the door and look out, you can see, along the top wall there are three figures. Takes you a moment to focus, and you realize that it is Kendrick, who's one of your general guards you keep around, as well as Cordell and Shayne. All three of them have crossbows ready, and they're yelling to each other and aiming them over the wall towards the front. However, what you can hear from this point is a chorus of 20, 30 or more voices muffled from the other side of the wall. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h16m59s">&rarr;</a></dd>

And you and I are going to wait by the gate for those stragglers to come in.

<dd id="l0h19m29s">At this point, you hear this strange high-pitched whine sound. Vax, as you look up, you can see there are these columns of smoke that are billowing out of the city in the distance as mass areas are burning and smoldering. You see coming out of one of the clouds something spinning slowly towards you, and you look up and see it's one of the skyships from the Cloudtop District, one half of it currently in flames. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h19m29s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h20m12s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h20m12s">Okay. The gate opens a little bit, enough to get one or two people through, and begins to push through, and you can see now people are yelling in pain as they're being crushed, as the whole mass of them are pushing through the small opening. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h20m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h20m35s">At this point, the skyship has passed overhead, missing the top of the keep and the highest walls by about 40 or so feet. For a few seconds of silence, and you hear impact, shaking the ground for a few seconds. Not far from here, you can see another blast of red fire and a couple of sparks of arcane energy that arc out, as another column of smoke south of you begins to pour up into the sky. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h20m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h21m6s">Okay. As you start rushing in that direction, to the south side of the castle, looking back to where the skyship came through, you can see the smoke parts once more, and you see unfurling from within two large white wings bearing down, and you can see as it swoops down, there are groups of people that are rushing 100, 200, 300 feet away, that are pulling themselves out of the ravine that sits between the south walls of Emon and the north walls of your keep. As they're pouring through the mud and the stream there, it's about four or five feet deep, it swoops down and unleashes a blast of freezing cold energy that freezes that whole section of the river solid and every person in that vicinity as well. Locked in place. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h21m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h48m33s">30. Trinket heals up-- As Pike reaches out, grasping her symbol in one hand, a look of desperation in her face, her hand goes out and touches the ice and as her hand touches, her fingers melt through through the ice with divine energy in her fingertips, and manages to touch Trinket's fur beneath. As the divine energy filters through her body, Trinket's form glows from the inside and the ice begins to crack before it all shatters off of Trinket's body and Trinket catches himself (bear grunts) and shakes off what little bit of remaining ice and moisture is on the coat. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=0h48m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h8m23s">Cool. So-- All right, so yeah. I'll see if Shayne-- Shayne does not make it with a two, so Shayne takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. As she is rushing up, she's dropped her heavy crossbow and she's pulling a weapon out, and she rushes up, yelling, her red hair blown back from the wind as it's beating towards her. She gets bludgeoned with the sheer force of the wind from under the wings and knocked flat on her back. At the end of that attack, it now gets to move half its movement and so it-- There we go, a fly speed of 80, it's going to move 40 feet. So that will put it at 20 up this way as it starts backing away. And it's going to move 20 feet in this direction. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h8m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Shoulder to shoulder, she, as opposed to the crossbow at this point, and seeing the two of you can work together in this regard, she pulls out a broadsword.

<dd id="l1h13m22s">You guys hear a voice come ringing out from the north side, towards where Emon is. A familiar voice that you've heard before that shouts out, "Enough! You are not to linger, follow the others." At which point, you see the white dragon glances over the shoulder, and you hear the voice again say, "Vorugal!" And a streak of smoke and red. The red dragon you saw that had perched itself in the center of the city grapples onto the back of Vorugal and throws the dragon off the edge of the wall. And goes tumbling to the south of the keep. Out from the perspective. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h13m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h14m32s">The red dragon you haven't heard the name of yet. Umbrasyl is the black dragon. Raishan was the green dragon. So as you hear the impact, you hear the dragon screeching out in anger and no one has any visual at this point, you just hear the sounds over the side. You hear it skid to a halt, but the red dragon is still flying and grabs it, throws it, makes it hit the ground, almost like a show of dominance. And as it arcs back around, it ignores the keep and heads back towards Emon. You see Vorugal now lifting back up into the sky, staring back at the red dragon as it heads back, and you can see in its general demeanor, it's frustrated and angry and it begrudgingly begins to fly towards the east, where you saw the other two dragons continue. As the red dragon returns towards the city, its voice is ringing out at a volume that, even at this distance, is being enhanced by some sort of arcane means, whether it means-- it wants to be heard. And as you can see now, as it hits over the far south walls of Emon, it shouts out once more, "Hear me, insects! You that live do so "out of mercy. Fight or flee and you forfeit that mercy. Know that your pitiful guardians brought "this upon you. That blood is on <i>their</i> hands! Vengeance has been swift, and in its wake, a new "age is upon you." Making its way towards the center of the city. "Be thankful, for until now "your lives had no purpose. No meaning. Abandon your gods, your paltry convictions, for now you "have a new purpose: to serve me!" And with that, you hear the clattering impact once more of the Cloudtop District, as a half-dozen buildings collapse under its weight as it slams into the center of what probably still stood tall in the middle of the city of Emon. You hear the crumbling wreckage echoing in the distance as it slides to a halt. And a couple of distant slamming sounds as it makes its way into the central borough where the palace once was. Quiet now takes the air, as all the people are still standing frozen in fright of what they just saw, and slowly begin making their way into the keep, whispering, shaking, crying under their breaths, the survivors that are not frozen in the center of Greyskull Keep's courtyard. What do you want to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h14m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

While this is happening, Pike, Keyleth, Vax, Vex, Scanlan, all of you guys begin helping the guards take beds out of your rooms and bring them downstairs into the main foyer area, basically turning this into a makeshift living space for refugees. Heading towards and moving them into the temple of Sarenrae, as you go into the temple of Sarenrae, you get a bit of a feel of the damage that was sustained from the impact of the dragon upon the top of the keep. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h24m6s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h24m36s">A large portion of the stained glass on the roof and on the outside has been shattered from rocks and boulders that were-- chunks of the top of the keep that were knocked off, and looking up you can see the roof of the keep itself sustained a fair amount of damage. Not enough to really be a serious issue, but it is in a bit of disrepair visually. As you guys are taking the beds from the upstairs to the downstairs, you do notice that a portion of the roof has caved in on the second floor. The guest room has been ruined and the southmost room, which I'll have to check to see who's supposed to be living there, is partially collapsed inwards and you can see the ceiling-- the sky from underneath. There is a fair amount of damage to the top of the keep from the impact. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h24m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As the light fades, you can see, levitating roughly a foot off the ground, a human. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h26m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h26m48s">White eyes and pale blue skin, hairless with a simple breastplate that's silver with gold lining on it, a single sword sheathed on the side, and beautiful white angel wings sprouting from its back. The entity stands there and looks down towards you. "I have been sent to your aid. Are "you, Pike Trickfoot, to give me a task?" The voice itself seems otherworldly, and understanding the basis of the spell, you need a specific task in mind for it, and it is expensive to maintain in materials, the longer the task requires. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h26m48s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h39m12s">Hi, my name is Matthew Mercer, I'm a voice actor and the dungeon master for Geek and Sundry's Critical Role, and welcome to my short video series for my tips on how to dungeon master or game master your own roleplaying games. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">So today, our first topic is going to be Encounter Building. So when you are creating an encounter, a combat encounter specifically for your party of adventurers or space marines or whatever else you are running, you want to consider what kind of terrain or region is this going to have. That's going to go ahead and help you guide what creatures are going to be there, what type of challenges might be in that way. So consider, is it a icy tundra, is it a frozen mountaintop or is it like a hot, muggy swampland, is it a underground cave network? There are actually a lot of these resource books that you can find for these RPGs that will have listings of creatures and monsters and dangers by topography, and by weather, and that's a really cool way to see what indigenous creatures might live there, and that's a good resource to pull from if you're not having any creative juices helping you decide what to put in front of them. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">Secondly, you want to consider how challenging you want the encounter or encounters to be. Do you want it to be a really quick scuffle, do you want it to be a series of small battles, as to opposed to fighting in a long hallway, in a spaceship? Do you want it to be one giant climatic multi-leveled boss confrontation? Once you've made that decision, that'll help you figure out how dangerous, how extensive, and how powerful the villains may be for this encounter. There's a lot of great resource manuals for every RPG system out there that have breakdowns about what creatures are good for which player levels as far as power or challenge and danger is concerned. Like, for instance, the dungeon master's guide and monster manual have a challenge rating system. A creature of a certain challenge rating is a decent challenge for a group of four players of that level, and you can slide the scale from there. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">Also, the DMG, or the Dungeon Master's Guide, has a experience threshold table in there as well that helps you build encounters based on the total experience points the creatures are fighting. So those are really cool resources, if you're new to the system and you're still trying to figure out how to balance that properly. Over time, eventually you'll just get a feel for it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">Experience helps you get a little more comfortable with balancing the battle, and you want to make sure you don't kill all your players way too quickly in the game, either. There's also a really good website called Kobold Fight Club, for those who are running Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition campaigns, that helps them build an entire encounter with the experience table stuff that helps you get an idea of what could and could not be considered too powerful. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">And don't forget, if you can't find a creature or monster in these realms or any sort of villain that suits your need for the storyline or this particular battle, you can create one. Make one up or take something that's there and customize it and alter it, make it more powerful, make it weaker, you know? If you really, really want to run a game that has a bunch of kobolds as the main villain, but all your players are level ten? Go ahead and make yourself some more powerful kobolds. You can customize 'em all you want. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">Everything in there is just a baseline suggestion of what they think, or they created initially to be, but you can always scale them, you can make them more powerful, you can add additional hit points, make them do more damage per attack. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">Increase their defenses, give it some hidden resistances or vulnerabilities. You can even create whole new abilities, I customize creatures all the time for my game. I think it, one, makes it more interesting and more customized to the specific encounter and world. Secondly, for players who have been playing for a long time and pretty much memorized the monster manual, it keeps them on their toes because they'll be encountering monsters that they have yet to memorize everything about. Also, make sure, though, if you do use these creatures and you want them to have interesting defenses and vulnerabilities and the like, make sure you highlight them or note them, it's very easy to rush into combat and forget some of these cool things. So I always use a highlighter and highlight the various notes and elements of these creatures or these combat scenarios that I want to make sure that I remember and recall in the heat of battle. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">The next note I want to bring up is battlefields. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">First and foremost, not every game needs a battlefield. In fact, I kind of prefer RPGs that don't have a battle map with miniatures, it's just a way to play. I prefer to keep things in my imagination, but that's generally more wieldy with smaller groups, if you have three, maybe four players. Larger than that, it gets a little unwieldy, and me running six to eight players, it has become very necessary for everyone to keep track of their spatial awareness. When you create a map, things to consider, creative terrain. You know, think of where it's are happening, but ways to make it different on occasion, too. You can have straight forward battles with just, here's an area where they fight, here's some hallways, here's some rooms, and that's cool, too, but if you're in an urban setting, have furniture they can use to their advantage, whether it be for height or for setting up blockades. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">Also, consider what other challenges and confrontations they might have with the terrain during the battlefield. Is there a giant chasm they have to get across to actually get to the villain while they're attacking them from a distance? Is there some sort of arcane field that's locked off a portion of the battlefield and they have to figure out some sort of puzzle during the battle to lock it down? Is invulnerable to all damage until they can find some sort of hidden aspect of their soul locked within a nearby battlefield, or is there a bunch of innocents in there as well that are in danger of being killed from the collateral damage? Find cool and unique ways to make it an interesting battle outside of a slug fest of HP being knocked away and whoever falls first. Mind you, those can be fun, too, on occasion, but you want to make sure to keep things interesting. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">For those who want to create battlefields, what I use for my battlefields, because it has been requested a few times. You can use easel pad paper, one-inch grid easel pad paper that you can find online, and that's a real cool way to draw on that using markers and create your own battlefields that way. There are great tutorials online too that show you how to make cool battles and interesting-looking terrain with simple hatch-mark shading and minor colors, so I highly recommend that. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">Also, when you're using intelligent creatures, especially monsters or individuals or villains that are understanding their own mortality, they may flee. When they hit about half or a quarter hit points, they maybe want to get the heck out of Dodge. So don't be afraid to let your villains or enemies do that on occasion. One, it ups the stakes immediately in a battle from a slog fest to, oh crap he's getting away, and the dynamic shifts to try and prevent them from doing so. And secondly, if they do manage to get away, you may have a juicy villain who can recur later on down the story with a need for vengeance. Vengeance! Another cool note, not all battles are meant to be won, either. Sometimes you want to introduce a really powerful enemy as a foreshadowing aspect, a creature that they can in no way, shape or form defeat, and they are meant to flee from, so that they can build towards down the road, maybe coming back and finally killing it as a means of vengeance. Just make sure you try and insinuate to the players that they shouldn't stick around for the whole fight or you might have a TPK on your hands, so be careful with that one. It's a fun tool, but be careful. No, seriously, be careful. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h39m12s">Plus, it also leaves a cool story like, "Man, you remember that one time we almost got killed by "that thing?" Not all fights are meant to end in bloodshed, as well. So don't be afraid to let the players diplomatically resolve an encounter. Sometimes battles happen because of misunderstandings or misinformation or the wrong thing was said and it ticks somebody off. That doesn't mean they have to fight to the bitter end and murder whoever's in front of them. You don't want the whole murderhobo syndrome to be consistent, unless that's the campaign you're running, in which case, fight on, my murderhobos. But let the players use their social skills to try and defuse an encounter before anyone gets killed. I've many games where halfway through a battle, they're like, "Wait, "they may have information we need," or, "Maybe we were duped and have the wrong information," and they decide to diplomatically end it. It doesn't always work, but it's nice to give them that option. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=1h39m12s">&rarr;</a></dd>

A battle, however, that it was unable to win. Sent away, "mortally wounded, it was thought that the dragon had died soon after, having not been seen for many "centuries since.

It had "survived and secretly ruled the island of Viscan in the south of the Lucidian Ocean.

But we were "overpowered by the sheer might of the dragon. Many lives were lost. Knowing that we could not kill "it, we turned to other means. I called upon the Arcana Pansophical, a circle of friends, arcane "practitioners that agreed to work together across the land to keep them safe. They devised a trap, "one that could, we believed, permanently seal Thordak within the elemental plane of fire, "preventing him from ever returning to our world. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=2h36m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h51m22s">So you take Allura's hand and you put your focus into the crystal sphere, your vision lifts out of the keep with extreme speed. You find your visual surroundings thrust across the Ozmit Sea. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=2h51m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h51m22s">You find yourself swooping across the shores of Othanzia, over the forests, eventually coming upon the blackened clouds that perpetually hang above the charred mountain range that contains the home of the Fire Ashari and the entrance to the elemental plane of fire. Your vision crests the mountain and steps into the valley of broken, blackened shale to the ever-burning forest. As you come upon it, you recall where the Fire Ashari village was and where you were greeted before and given your trials. Where there is now nothing but sundered, broken wood, tents, destroyed bodies burned and charred and curled up in horrible ever-gasping pain. The forest itself is flattened from the inside out, like a blast from the center of it just exploded outward, the trees all bent and snapped at the base, and in the center, where there once was that small pool of molten lava that you created the portal through and stepped into the elemental plane, there is a large, ominous, flickering gash between the planes that is roughly 30 to 40 feet in width and height that is pulsing as fire and magma pours out of it. You can see wandering imps and elementals and various entities slowly peeking out and escaping and wandering throughout the mountain tops. From what you can see, there are no signs of any survivors. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=0W_by9hT6VQ&t=2h51m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
