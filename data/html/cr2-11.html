<dd id="l0h0m0s">Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Welcome. Before we get started tonight, we're going to get through some quick announcements. First and foremost, we have two sponsors tonight. Number one, our fresh sponsor for the evening is the fantastic upcoming film by the fantastic, glorious Guillermo del Toro, Pacific Rim. Uprising. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h0m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m27s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m27s">I got that! Pacific Rim Uprising. It's going to be in theaters, RealD 3D, and IMAX tomorrow, Friday, March 23rd. My wife and I, we original Gipsy Danger fans, I'm just saying, I'm just going to put it out there, that's what we represent at the house. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h0m27s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m43s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m43s">We're big fans. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h0m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h0m44s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h0m44s">I'm telling you. You can get tickets now at PacificRimTickets.com. The movie takes place ten years after the first film. A mysterious organization has reopened the breach for the Kaiju, and a Jaeger has gone rogue. It is up to John Boyega and his sweet 'stache, and his character, Jake Pentecost, to fight back and prevent humanity's extinction. It is out tomorrow. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h0m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m4s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m4s">How could you not be more badass than playing the son of Idris Elba? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h1m4s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m7s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m7s">I'm telling you, man. I just want one of those outfits. I just want a Jaeger pilot outfit formed specifically to my body. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h1m7s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m16s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m16s">So if you work in the effects team for Pacific Rim, and have an extra suit lying around, please send them to P.O.-- no. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h1m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m20s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m20s">Yeah! I'll work it into the story! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h1m20s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m22s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m22s">Then a little Kaiju cosplay for Charlie, because we were saying Charlie was a Kaiju level negative three, or something? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h1m22s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m32s">#</a> <strong>TRAVIS</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m32s">He destroys nothing except carpets with his pee. Pacific Rim Uprising, tomorrow night, go see it, because I got my tickets. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h1m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m40s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m40s">There you go. And of course, our fantastic returning sponsor for the season, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond. For those of you who haven't checked that out, D&amp;D Beyond, it's awesome, they allow you to do all your stuff online for your D&amp;D campaign, your character. Sam, do you have something to say about that? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h1m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h1m55s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h1m55s">For this week's D&amp;D Beyond spot, I wrote a hilarious skit for me and Ashley to perform together, but she's not here. Instead, I'm going to soldier on without her in the spirit of showmanship. Hey Ashley, guess what I'm thinking right now? (silence) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h1m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m11s">Well hey, there's no need for that language. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h2m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m11s">Listen, I was thinking how useful D&amp;D Beyond is for tracking your stats. For instance, did you see all the new races in fifth edition? (silence) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h2m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m25s">Aasimar, I hardly knew her! It would be way better if she were here. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h2m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m25s">Hey, I've got one. How many tortles does it take to screw in a lightbulb? (silence) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h2m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m36s">(laughs) Exactly. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h2m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m36s">Hey guys, the promo code from last week, InvisibleWand, is still active for 25% off any purchase from the D&amp;D Beyond store. But Ash, why don't you tell them the secret other promo code that unlocks everything on the site for free? (silence) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h2m36s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h2m55s">Boy, I hope they wrote that one down. Also, any legendary bundle owners who purchased prior to Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes can apply the same code to the new book. Ashley, Mordenkainen: Am I pronouncing that right? (silence) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m9s">Well, I don't know why you had to bring my mom into this, but whatever. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h3m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m9s">Anyway, on behalf of D&amp;D Beyond, I'm Sam Riegel! (silence) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h3m9s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m16s">And, as always, the motto of D&amp;D Beyond is? (silence) <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h3m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h3m21s">That's the one. Thanks, everybody. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h3m21s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m23s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>

<dd id="l0h3m25s">I don't know if it could've been better. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h3m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dt><a href="#l0h3m28s">#</a> <strong>SAM</strong></dt>

One, we are saying goodbye tonight to a dear friend, our fantastic director of photography here on the program for a long time, Selena Ruth, she is moving on to much better pastures. We give all the love, and share love as well for the wonderful journey that's before her. Thank you! You're amazing! <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h3m40s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h4m28s">Yeah, it's incredible! If you haven't done so, check it out! It costs you nothing and it's an extra click. Those who may have been here earlier might have seen we have the Critical Role recaps, so if you need a refresher for campaign two, the first ten episodes of the new campaign in Critical Role are now available on YouTube as the Critical Role Recap, hosted by our beloved Dani Carr, who is a longtime OG Critter, now member of this crazy team, and the person who, if you didn't know, originated the term, "Is it Thursday yet?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h4m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h5m46s">Liam, stop it. Podcast of last week's episode, episode ten, is available for download where all fine podcasts are downloadable, so if you have friends who are in the audio-only version of the campaign or you want to listen to it while you're on your commute, it's available for download now. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h5m46s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h7m25s">#</a> <strong>LAURA</strong></dt>

Because we're accepting backorders right now. So that's still available in the store. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h7m25s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h7m51s">Just know that if you order them there's a little bit of a delay, but it's fine, you can still get it. Put it in now, that way you can be sure you're getting it this time. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h7m51s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Once again, our fantastic charity, 826, and 826LA, and all the other 826 chapters out there, they do fantastic work with underprivileged kids and teens in creative writing, they have great classes and tutoring programs. If you have the opportunity to donate either some money or your time, if you want to volunteer as well, highly recommend it. Please look into it. They're awesome folks. Thank you, guys. Let's see, last but not least, a quick retooling that I'll be at Otafest in Calgary, up in Canada, May 18th to the 20th, and A-Kon in Texas June 7th through 10th, so come to either of those events if you can to say hello, I'd love to hang out.

Last we left off, The Mighty Nein, the intrepid adventurers, had completed their task they had achieved from the King's Hall Taskboard to eliminate this spider scourge that had seemingly clogged up a portion of the sewers, discovered a subtle passage into the more upper class elements of the city, managed to extract some information from an individual they had saved from the webbing there, got your reward for it, had a conversation with Ulog of the Knights of Requital, who had discussed interest in possibly bringing you in for some endeavor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h10m26s">&rarr;</a></dd>

However, the distant thunder rolls continue to quake the muffled interior of the rooms you're at, the lightning strikes flashing through the rooms that have a respective window, and the heavy impacts causing you to wake up in the middle of the evening at times with a restless bit of sleep. A faint drip of wayward rain seems to have collected and found its way through the roof of Beau and Jester's room, and the pattering in the corner of this small, building puddle causes you to frustratingly go and collect it, find something to at least keep it from making that noise throughout the evening. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h14m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

As you begin to come through, some of the carts are closed in the middle of the market: the ones that are more open that sell fresh goods or things that can be ruined by rainwater and that don't have quite as strong of a canopy, but there are some that are still open. They have hooded lanterns out to draw attention towards them, you have barkers shouting out, "Meats, fresh meats!" and trying to get your attention over there, but you guys maneuver through, making a beeline to your location.

The whole interior here is such stark contrast to the rest of the city. It is both surprising and sickening knowing some of the harder lifestyles that exist on the outside of the walls here. There are a few large sights as you pass through here. There is-- one of the large towers here is part of the ivory and marble structure that has large blue banners that hang down the sides. The central tower itself fires up into the sky. This centerpiece-- and you've known this because you've been here before-- is known as the Zauber Spire. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h57m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h58m57s">Zauber Spire. Z-A-U-B-E-R S-P-I-R-E. The Zauber Spire. It is the central piece of the Halls of Erudition campus and lords over that entire section to the north side. It is the furthest tower here. There is an area that you've heard of but not been to called the Gilded Willows, which is the tree-dappled residential area of the city. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=0h58m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h0m56s">It is relatively crowded. A lot of the folks are bundled up. They have large mittens on, heavy coats and cloaks and a lot of the general elite that live in this vicinity have come here to pick up warm goods to help go against the cold rain that's now coming down upon the city. To the right of that, towards the very edge of this road of various shops and market bits, there is a building that is small with a thatched roof, like it's more for the visual aspect of it. It's made to look almost like a small country cottage but it's plainly intentional and is an aesthetic that's been placed onto it to make it look different and interesting from the rest of the-- <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=1h0m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h14m31s">It's meant as an intimidation tactic. It's this high-pitched screaming cricket chirp that rushes in, so that's where the term "Crick" comes from. It is used in a derogatory fashion towards individuals who live within the empire of Xhorhas and Kryn. The book talks about them dueling wits, finding common ground, and getting angry at each other and murderous, then turns into this torrid love affair in this very Anthony/Cleopatra feel to it. It's very dry. It's an older book. It doesn't match some of the imaginatory flair of some of the other smut that you briefly perused as you were walking in the bookstore earlier. You glean a little bit of information, should this be accurate at all, of some of the relationships or dynamics of the empire and the Xhorhasian folk that live beyond the border. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=2h14m31s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h23m8s">Ulog has been-- and please, take no offense, we're just very careful-- keeping a very close eye on your activities since we last met. Bit of a scare as you entered the King's Hall, but I've heard that you've done a bit of business, unrelated. He speaks to your skill and we may have--" He looks nervously over, and Horris leans forward and goes, "We put two months into planning something, and it requires certain skill sets. Ulog, if you'd like to elaborate on this." The dwarf leans forward, pulls one of the lanterns closer, so all your faces brighten up just a bit. He turns the wick up a bit. "So we've intercepted some documents to Lord Sutan, one of the pretty faces and money grabbers over there in the Tri-Spire. Very politically connected. Apparently, he's been doing some business with a lowlife who's known in the more crown-based circles as one of those arrest-on-sight types. We believe this individual might be involved with The Myriad. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=2h23m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h24m56s">"We tried to bring this information to the Lawmaster, Orentha, as she is a friend of Dolan's. However, we were intercepted by the High-Richter Prucine. She's about as corrupt as you get in the structure here in Zadash. She intercepted it, so that she delivered the information. I've heard nothing since. A couple of our members have been closely watched by the Crownsguard ever since. So we believe the High-Richter might be in on it. We've decided if we can somehow turn Lord Sutan against the High-Richter, and then expose them to the Lawmaster, they'll either be arrested or ousted from their positions. Which, one, would be victory for those who don't want to live under the claws of corruption in this city. And two, vacates the position of High-Richter. While Horris' practice may have been irrevocably damaged in the public eye, Dolan is a respected member of the society here. The locals at least. We believe that, if not the High-Richter himself, perhaps another position as things shift. It would behoove us--" Dolan puts his hand up and says, "It would be helpful to have at least one of us with an ear on the bead of the inner circle of how law is distributed within Zadash. While it is not my bailiwick, people seem to trust me, and I think that's the most important thing when taking an office. We've outlined a means of doing so. This is where we may need your help." Looks over to Kara, and the half-elf leans forward, "All right then, so, the current plan is to infiltrate the Lord Sutan's estate in the Tri-Spire, steal a copy of his wax seal, and his handwriting. After we forge a little of the correspondence to this unsavory individual who he was speaking to in this letter, we make a new one that writes about an assassination of the High-Richter, sealed, and signed by the Lord Sutan. Then, we infiltrate the home of the High-Richter, tear apart her living space, look like it's been tousled and tossed, like someone was seeking her while she was out for the night, at a local ball, which she'll be one night from here. Before she returns to find her place destroyed, we take this letter that we found and left it, hidden within her room. She finds the letter, brings it to the Lawmaster--" At this point, Ulog pipes in real fast, "Sorry, misunderstood. She doesn't get the letter. We deliver it ourselves to the Lawmaster. I don't trust her to take it." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=2h24m56s">&rarr;</a></dd>

So if I was the Richter, and I went to the Lawmaster, I'd just go disappear Lord Sutan.

Talking of this terrible life of endless wastes of carnivorous and cannibalistic creatures and that the Crick nation being this terrible place of perpetual inner turmoil, and vying for the next position of power. The assassin that falls into this relationship falls into it as perspective of being saved, of being taken from this terrible place and brought into the good graces of this General, and brought into the comforting realm of the Empire. However, upon being discovered, ends up being captured, tried, and killed. The last part of the book deals with the General going through his own grief and the process, but also understanding it never could be, and was probably for the best. You're left with a unsatisfied meh feeling at the end of it all. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=3h9m57s">&rarr;</a></dd>

At a mass majority, you do slip around the same area where you had the original confrontation, you do see some more of those rats scattered about, but you manage to quickly dart by. In a few moments, you hear a (hiss) turn as they notice something, but they go in the direction, as you go in to move past. Some of them shift in where you were but no longer where you are. The blind rats are going by the sound and being misled a bit, so you manage to maneuver around without any immediate conflict. Eventually, you make your way back to where those webs were situated before the phase spider's little domain there at the edge. Still in tatters, untouched from where you left it. You head back to the rung and you can see the entranceway into the Tri-Spire District. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=3h22m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l3h45m47s">As you guys make your way to the interior of the inn, it is lively. It is the loudest, musically, tavern, you've seen. You get the sense, both by title, and by the interior, that this essentially a perpetual an open mic night for any musicians or bards who want to come and try out their craft. There are three different bands that are cycling through on the main, raised dais to perform. The atmosphere is lively, and folks come here for that. It's a poor tavern, comparatively. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=3h45m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l3h45m47s">The interior looks like a lot of the paint is chipped and run or crinkled, the smell inside is not the best, but it serves basic food, basic drinks, and at least an atmosphere of music and fun. Some folks sing along, and jump into a shanty or two. As you come in, you can see both Ulog and Dolan are currently sitting at a table across from each other. As they notice you guys approach, they raise a drink, and you can see the rest of the table they have ready for you guys to come and sit. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=w3JWNPcspoM&t=3h45m47s">&rarr;</a></dd>
