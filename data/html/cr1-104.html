<dd id="l0h0m16s">Once again, I hope people can hear. Marvel Puzzle Quest is an awesomely addictive role playing puzzle game where Marvel's fearless superheroes come to life! You can download it now on the iTunes, the Google Play, the Amazon App Store, and the Steam. And now, a rare 5-star Spider-man has arrived in Marvel Puzzle Quest just in time for Spider-man: Homecoming, the movie. You can recruit Spidey and play in two new boss missions featuring the Sinister Six. Face the Vulture, or recruit him as a supervillain for your team. Now, to celebrate the awesomeness that is Marvel Puzzle Quest, I have another one of my famous puzzles for Taliesin. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h0m16s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h9m52s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h9m52s">Anyway. Last we left off, Vox Machina had confronted the Whispered One, the Undying King Vecna, in the Shadowfell. The battle did not go in your favor, with the death and very faint recovery of Vex, and the disintegration of Vax during this confrontation. Realizing that it was not going in your favor, you Plane Shifted to the Feywild, where you began to come up with some sort of plot or plan to try and bring your friend, Vax, back without a body. During this time Vax had a conversation with his patron, the Raven Queen, and was given an offer where he could return along with powers that would aid in this coming final confrontation. However, the deal came with some drawbacks, and upon his friends awakening the next morning in the Feywild, they found Vax returned to them, whole. Seemingly alive, returned, though missing his equipment. Equipment returned, and a brief period of figuring out what possibly delivered their friend back to this space. It was decided that based on his experience with his patron that the powers beyond the Divine Gate-- the Prime Gods that lay claim to the divine beyond the Prime Material plane will probably be the next best bet in gaining some sort of power, information about how to better prepare for the coming struggle with Vecna, the Whispered One. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h9m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m52s">You then made your way to Vasselheim, where Pike went to her temple of Sarenrae which she had helped raise and reconstruct, and had a vision from her patron deity asking her to come visit her at the Island of Renewal, and was granted, through this vision, an object that would link, via your spell, a way to traverse past the Divine Gate and directly to her location on the plane of Elysium. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h9m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h9m52s">Also, Grog and Scanlan had a little excursion in the city of Vasselheim and a minor altercation with the guards, which led to a larger altercation with the guards, which led to a much larger altercation with the guards, which led to them barely escaping and deciding it's time to go. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h9m52s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h12m11s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m11s">Yeah. You guys then clasped hands, and using the Plane Shift spell found yourselves stepping down on the crunching sand-like shores of the Island of Renewal. There looking past the clusters of stone and trees that mark the perimeter of this interesting, beautiful, strange distant landscape. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h12m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h12m11s">You can see beyond the tree line and the hills that jut up from the floor the crystalline structure that seems to mark the center of the Island, and that is where we left off. What would you guys like to do? <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h12m11s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h12m53s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h12m53s">It appears to be, yeah. The granules of the sand are too big to be tiny sand granules, they're about pearl-size, maybe a little bit smaller. And they're smooth, and they seem to reflect the light in a very beautiful way. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h12m53s">&rarr;</a></dd>

Held amongst the center of these wings is a large, gem-like flame. And you see within the actual crystalline-- we'll call it like a palace, if you will-- it looks like there's a light source within that flickers and dances like an eternal bonfire or flame, and it seems to have a pulse to it. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h14m17s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h24m10s">Okay, then. All righty, so with Pike leading on and approaching the pathways that lead towards the center of the island, the rolling hills ascend higher and higher, the further towards where the distant crystal monolith resides. Up from the soft, pearl-like sand to reveal large obelisks of carved rectangular stone at off-kilter angles, jutting out of the ground in places. You had seen some of these at a distance when you arrived and you as well in your vision, Pike, earlier. The trees you walk past begin to slowly thin out to replace some of these stone structures. You can see what's almost this outer ring of nature that encloses the inner portion of this island. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h24m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h24m10s">The wind is now warm against your skin as it begins to whip through this area and you can hear it tear through some of the openings between these ever densely growing clusters of stonework. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h24m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h24m10s">Occasionally, these stone structures resemble figures of old ancient figureheads from the Age of Arcanum, who bore the embrace of the Everlight with them before her following fell from grace. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h24m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h24m10s">You can see the ravages of time and the diminishing of her influence following the Divergence are shown on some of these figures as they appear to be sheared or cracked or broken in places. But still, no sign of anything else moving on the island. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h24m10s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h26m32s">Pike, you lead on. You make your way through these tangled paths and they shift and curve and turn and the light never seems to change overhead and as you hike along and chat amongst yourselves and keep open to the vicinity around you and you're breathing in the clean air with hints of seaspray and saltiness that eventually makes its way through the breeze. You can feel parts of you sweat beneath your armor, from the general warmth of the atmosphere, and you travel for about an hour. Pike, and Vex and Vax and Keyleth, you pick up on this, too. The crystalline structure in the center of the island doesn't appear to be any closer. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h26m32s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h39m44s">Okay. As you guys walk alongside, focusing on Pike and her leading this small pack of friends along through the heavily rolling hills and the pieces of stone obstruction that force you to make your way around. You help guide her around these various obstructions that get in the way. Pike, you're concentrating on this burning beacon of warmth ahead of you. And within three minutes of travel, it seemed almost closer than when you saw her disappear before. You guys look at her, and glance up and you've just come across the threshold of the stones, and you're now in this open sandy patch at the base of this large crystal structure. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h39m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l0h40m44s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l0h40m44s">Standing before this magnificent glass-like structure, you can see the winding shapes and edges clearly ascending in the form of a female torso, rising from beneath the sands to a staggering height. Two wings of glittering crystal curving upward to frame a massive round red gem that shines above the head of the woman, with flames curling from the inside of the facets. This red gem would probably be about twice the size of Grog. It's hard to see the actual height of it here, but it's probably close to a hundred feet tall, the entire structure. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h40m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h40m44s">Now, you see the shifting flicker of the intense fire that burns within the palace, now, it's causing the shadows cast by all nearby things to dance behind you, and in the inside you can see what appears to be a heavy bonfire almost that is visible beyond a 20-foot domed doorway right at the base of the torso. As you begin to approach the entrance to this crystalline palace-like statue, the heat of those flames that you see inside, roaring and burning quickly, get hotter and hotter on your skin. And as you begin to enter the interior of this structure, the heat feels like it should be getting close to unbearable, but it never hurts. You acknowledge the temperature change, and you're used to knowing this much heat should hurt, but it never does. It's just hot and welcoming. You now stand within the hollow interior of this incredible wonder, looking at a spiraling red tower of orange-red flame that reaches up about 60 feet or so, in this spiral. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h40m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h40m44s">It's all flame. This large bonfire in the center of this structure. It flares rhythmically, like a very intentional heartbeat. (roaring flames) Giving these whipping sounds of the heat, and the wind and the air that it's tossing upward and out into the rest of the island around you and you now begin to acknowledge the warm winds that were blowing through the island, all seem to be centering and spiraling out from the center of the island. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h40m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h40m44s">And it's at that point that you see something in the flame begin to take shape. You watch as this dark outline begins to open up as two large wings unfurl from within, revealing feathers of ivory and pearl, like the beach you arrived on, as this 15-foot-tall feminine vision of Sarenrae emerges from the roaring pyre, long curling flames burn as her hair from her beautiful dark skin framing a warm and motherly smile, her eyes gold and brown like the most polished brass. Her robes of light blue unfurl in endless strands that almost seem to tether her to the inferno behind her, and as she emerges from the flame, you can't help but find yourself stunned and awed at the presence. Her standing there unsinged from the flames, slowly descends, still floating above you, her arms out, her wings and hair unfurled, almost like a canopy above the group as you look up at her. Her face turns and smiles onto small Pike on the ground, and you hear her voice for the first time for all of you, but not the first for Pike, who has heard her voice for a very long time. "My Pike, you come "to me after all this time. Such a beacon in a very dark world. Welcome." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h40m44s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h45m8s">She descends faintly. Her massive form slowly seems to-- not shrink, but shift perspective a bit, where once she was this massive entity before you, seems almost human in size as the hand comes down and reaches and touches the top of Pike's forehead and just runs down the nose, onto her chin. And you see the brow furrow a bit as she says, "You vanished from my sight. You walk paths "cast in shadow. My sands whisper thoughts of sorrow and foreboding. I must know from you all, "what dark tidings bring you before me harboring such emotion?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h45m8s">&rarr;</a></dd>

She reaches down and lifts you off the ground a bit, looking at your face, the bit of sadness that creeps across it as she lifts you up and you guys watch as she glides, passing through the crystal, Pike being brought below the archway as she just lifts her out beyond this crystal structure. She ascends upward about 25, 30 feet or so, holding Pike in her hands out in front of her. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h57m28s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h58m35s">No. Holding her close-- and by this point, Sarenrae's form has expanded to almost the size of the crystal structure you came to. You can now see a parallel between her wings and her form and her torso as to the actual incredible presence of this god before you. And leans in, as she shows the island to Pike below and whispers close to your ear, "I'm not lonely here, Pike, for my sands "remain with me, speak with me, and we learn from each other. Look." As she extends her arm, Pike, you look out, and all of the light of the sky seems to shine at once through every pearl, every grain of the beach sand that you've walked across. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h58m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l0h58m35s">And where once you saw what was just a barren landscape, you now see thousands and thousands and thousands of people. Opaque. Translucent. Souls of those that have come to Sarenrae since the dawn of creation. Those who swore themselves to good under her banner and at the end of their lives came to become part of the Island of Renewal and forever live with her and amongst the rest of the community of people that are warmed under her light. They all seem to look up at once at you, and you sense them smiling, as the vision fades and the island goes back untouched. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h58m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l0h58m35s">"You see, one day, you will join us, too. And we "will all have so many stories to share."

"While I am diminished, my powers limited, "you do possibly face something terrible, unseen since the Calamity. And for this journey, Pike, I "grant you my blessing." And as she reaches her hands out and they expand, her head lifts up, her eyes close, and her wings flare into a phoenix-like flame that just emblazons the sky with light and fire. The heat is more intense than anything you've felt, yet still there's no pain. It's just all-consuming. It's like the rebirth of a phoenix and you're all surrounded by it. For a moment, it's all there is in existence, just this incredible entity. And then the flames slowly die away, except for the flames that currently engulf Pike's gnome form. And as the flames burn away, you can see on Pike the familiar set of wings you've seen her spiritual form hold, which fold in and then dissipate. You now have the Blessing of the Everlight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=0h58m35s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h10m33s">Okay, so you begin to leap up through the branches, and a lot of the trees here have winding and knotted branches, so it's pretty easy to find your way up the canopy after maybe a five minute climb. You get up and peek over and you can see now this orchard goes on for miles and miles, and miles, filling this vast valley that you can barely see mountains that crest the edge of it in the distance near the horizon. You also see there is no cloud in the sky, and there is no sun, but there is a single pillar of light that streaks down from way way up, the zenith striking down in the center of this orchard, where there you see before you this awe-inspiring sight of the Dawnfather's home: a gold-plated citadel of many humongous towers and spires that both resembles a military fortress and the largest-steepled church you've ever seen. It's hard to gauge distance with so many trees between you and it, you don't know if it's miles off from you, if it's maybe a thousand feet or so, but even at this distance, it's incredible in its scale. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h10m33s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h16m23s">Actually, Vax, Vex, and Keyleth, you notice fairly quickly in that you begin to see movement ahead. The air itself, which by the way, the wind here is carrying a very sweet and fragrant, almost like honey flower whiffs that come through in waves that hit you, the whole atmosphere here makes you hungry, it makes you comfortable, it reminds you of childhood in a strange way. It's a very good, positive atmosphere. You begin to see as you approach, figures, moving. Pike, you recognize this because these are similar to the vision you just had from Sarenrae. They are entities. They are souls. They are people that walk the fields of Elysium, and you see them walk with small satchels, and you see them picking the fruit. And gathering, and harvesting. They don't seem to pay you too much mind, and as you begin to get close to some of them, they just stop and watch you. It's very Spirited Away, in a strange way. You see these somewhat translucent entities that barely acknowledge your existence and then as you pass by, they go on to whatever work they were doing. No speech, you don't even see eyes or faces, you just see the outline of the human-like shape, various heights and sizes. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h16m23s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You're getting to the edge of a clearing where the tree line comes to a halt, but as you do, it hurts your eyes a little bit. You have to adjust from the dark interior of the forest to the outside. And as you finally breach the edge of the tree line and look out, you can see this open clearing, and immediately you can see the column of light that's cracking down from the center of the sky is what is lining this clearing; where the light touches, the trees stop. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h22m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h22m24s">And it hurts a little bit to look at it because the light is reflecting off of this bright gold brass-colored citadel before you. You thought the crystal structure that Sarenrae was in was, you know, impressive. This is four times larger than the largest structures in Vasselheim or Emon you've ever encountered. And you watch as this massive citadel-- It has maybe two dozen separate towers of different heights that stagger and shift and they all come to these steeple-like points. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h22m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You see the outline of a few sparse trees that catch your attention. You do see some trees that litter this open space within this bright light that are of the same type of tree as the Sun Tree that resides in the center of Whitestone. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h22m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h26m50s">You guys begin to make your way on foot, trekking towards the center of this clearing, towards the fortress of the sun. As you begin to make your way beyond the various trees with their blossoming, beautiful white, pink, and purple blossoms that mark the Sun Tree during the spring and summer, you can now see along the perimeter of this what appear to be hundreds of figures. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h26m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l1h26m50s">Hundreds of figures that just dot the outside of the fortress.

<dd id="l1h26m50s">You can only surmise maybe the smallest one being 20 feet in diameter and going up from there on the scale on the central portions of it. And what's interesting is, usually with stained glass the bright exterior, the color is darkened and shaded because the light is once you're inside the structure, but the color is so vibrant in the stained glass, you get the sense that there is a light source within the actual fortress that is as bright if not brighter than the column of light that is descending from the sky. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h26m50s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h40m30s">At this point, the mass army that's been approaching you, you can see now, are hundreds of armored spirits, similar to those that you saw in the orchard. As they approach, the three planar entities that are walking alongside you put their hand up in a dismissive motion, and the army parts, leaving a singular path that leads you right to the front of the fortress. And the path, because there's so many, goes on. It's like walking through a parade of silence. As you all look around, you can't make out any faces. You see hundreds of sets of glittering golden armor with the somewhat-visible form of these translucent spiritual entities that take up the space. You don't sense any hostility, animosity. You don't sense any welcoming. You don't sense anything from them. They're present and letting you pass. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h40m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l1h41m24s">Yes, the armor is solid, and the spirits that inhabit them are pseudo-material. It's hard for you to gauge; you haven't encountered this type of creature outside of your spectral encounters with ghosts and other spirits. As you step forward, being flanked and escorted by these winged guards, you are brought to the base of the 50 or so steps that ascend to the front 40-foot-tall double doors that now (loud creaking) creak open to reveal the interior of the palace, which is as bright, if not brighter from the inside as the outside pillar of light you're leaving. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=1h41m24s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h2m55s">As you ascend the remainder of the stairs and step into the entryway to the Fortress of the Sun, you're led through a series of gorgeous silver and gold archways, dozens of feet above you. The intricacies of the interior, scrolling trim and inlay across every wall, pillar, and bannister is incredible. Not gaudy, just magnificent in purpose and history. Glancing across the marble floor, you can see the construction here is immaculate. There isn't any sort of smudge or damage dealt anywhere. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h2m55s">These arches themselves, even as you glance over and look, the detail seems to fractal smaller and smaller, in places, where you can't imagine a craftsman's hand could have built this. Only through the will of a god could such a thing come into creation on such a vast and minor scale. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h2m55s">You also notice as you walk in, there's no shadow or shade. The walls seem to almost emanate light on their own. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h2m55s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h4m30s">No shadow underneath you. Looking around you, and looking at your hands, you can see very faint shadows can be cast between your fingers and things that are very close, but it's like there's a diffused light throughout the entirety of the interior of the fortress that casts away any darkness or shadow. There's no umbra; there's no place where light is absent. It is just light everywhere. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h4m30s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h5m18s">Soft music you hear playing throughout the interior of the fortress, like this distant sound of a thousand soft choir voices accompanying the inspirational sight of the building that you now walk through. You see other entities adorned in armor, still opaque and pearlescent in their spirit form. Some of them have flowing robes of gold and white that trail behind them and drift across the floor silently. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h5m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h5m18s">The further in you walk, you begin to see where some of these spires and spiral staircases twist upward. The rooms have purpose in construction, but the scale of those that walk through the halls is so varied that you see staircases on large scales and small scales. They almost seem to wrap around each other in places. It's surreal, almost Escher-esque in some of the interior construction. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h5m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h5m18s">You see archways and doorways on different levels: some that appear to be reached only by those that can fly versus those that can just walk and climb. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h5m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h5m18s">Occasionally, you look up and you can see skylights across the top: some open glass and crystal, some appearing to be a small window of stained glass that glitters down in bright blues, purples, reds, oranges. There's definitely a stained glass motif in a lot of the interior of the fortress, which you've seen in some of Pelor's imagery, and the symbol around him is like a circular stained glass structure that spirals in with the actual star and the sun in the center. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h5m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h5m18s">The music continues to grow louder and louder the further in you walk, and you feel like you're being led along for a good 15 minutes straight. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h5m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h5m18s">This structure, this hallway, just goes on and on, the arches passing one after the other after the other. Your eyes have adjusted to the brightness of the interior now. Eventually, you come to another set of large doors. These doors themselves: no wood, no stone, just pure, vibrant platinum and gold. The symbol upon them seems to be the same circular motif as the symbol of the Dawnfather, with the star in the center, but the detail and intricacies. You get close, and your eyes-- especially you, Vex and Vax-- you glance and you can see, on every small scale, even just a simple bar of the star and the sun has writing, and has artwork, and then as you look closer, even on a smaller scale, that writing is comprised of smaller artwork and smaller writing. You're thrown off by the level of detail and intricacy of this place's construction. You're in awe. Your jaw drops as these reveals seem to barrage you with each step into the structure. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h5m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h5m18s">At that point, the doors (scraping noise) open, and you wince once again, as the light that fills the room from the inside is near-blinding. You close your eyes a bit, and all you hear is this deep, resonant voice say, "Come." <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h5m18s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dd id="l2h8m58s">You shield your eyes, upon stepping into the actual chamber, because otherwise, even closing your eyes isn't enough; the light is so intense. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h8m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h8m58s">It still hurts through your eyelids. As you step inside and look off, you can now glance around the interior of this chamber. The same level of fractal-like scrolling detail you saw in the doors lines every inch of the wall on the inside of this large, square chamber, hundreds of feet across on each side. It's incredible. The floor is almost mirrored in its polish. Glancing down, while there is no immediate shadow, behind you, the bright light does cast a bit behind you. You can see your reflection almost perfectly in the polished floor below. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h8m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h8m58s">You glance up, and you see the interior of that giant steeple-like tower that's sat at the center of the fortress in the distance, and you look up almost endlessly. You can see floor after floor with an endless spiral of various stained glass structures and reliefs and small statues that protrude from the edges, and this tower is seemingly hollow, just leading up, and you can't even make out the top of it from this distance. It looks like a tower that is infinite, almost, from this perspective, it's so big. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h8m58s">&rarr;</a></dd>

<dt><a href="#l2h10m43s">#</a> <strong>MATT</strong></dt>
<dd id="l2h10m43s">No, the light's coming from the center of the room. As your eyes slowly adjust and you glance past your fingers and your hands, you see there in the center of the chamber is a 25-foot throne of gold, brass, silver, and ruby. Sitting upon that throne sits a mighty being, wearing the most intricate and beautiful golden plate armor you've ever seen. Similar in detail and design as the interior of the chamber around you, it almost blends in if you didn't see it shift. A white cloak encases the shoulders of this entity and sways gently at their side like it's been brushed off and dangles over one of the arm rests. And where a head would be, instead there is a burning star, so bright that you can only look but a second before you have to avert your gaze and shut your lids out of the pain. Just enough time to barely make out the outline of what appears to be a male head, almost featureless, burning within the corona. This, you can only imagine, is the Dawnfather himself, Pelor. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h10m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>
<dd id="l2h10m43s">As you step into the chamber, the door (boom) closes behind you, and the winged planar entities that pushed you in are not in the chamber. It's just you... and the Dawnfather. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h10m43s">&rarr;</a></dd>

You, as you dive into the flames, feel this moment of searing bright pain in your eyes, in your mind. Your dragon form is immune to flames, but your form suddenly shrinks, the spell dispelled, the dragonoid form cast away. You sense this kind of lost nothing; your whole body is numb at this point, and you are just surrounded by a white light. Much like where Vax, in the plane in his communion with the Raven Queen is shrouded in darkness, this is endless, every color.

The flames were intended to cleanse away sin, darkness, possibly those who are unworthy. Is this it now? Did you fail? You guys down below watch as the chamber doors that closed off above you (scraping noise) open up again to reveal the tower. And you can see there, suspended in the middle of the air, thousands of shards of stained glass that had shattered inwards from the impact but frozen, held in place. As they all slowly retract back, reforming the windows that were once there. Whatever impact or shock wave had scattered them below reversed and repaired. And you watch as they do so, ascending, until the tower's back untouched as it was. The one planar that had ridden the dragon form of Vex towards the top of the tower slowly descends (flapping) and lands next to the three others. And they all give a nod towards the Dawnfather, who's still there, not looking upward, just looking at the rest of the remaining members of Vox Machina, his beacon of attention just shifting from one to the other. The three planars leave the still-open doors. "What does she mean to you?" <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=bAYN8qw7FYw&t=2h39m0s">&rarr;</a></dd>

But it's not in the Pools of Wittebak, just near it, this strange hovel. The voice of the Dawnfather burns forth once more, the heavy resonance shaking the room. "If you seek to devise "these Prime Trammels, then take this stone, my champion. It should be enough essence for one of "them." You watch as he reaches up into the halo, the corona of light around the head, and plucks from behind an ear a small bead of extremely bright light.
