Last we left off, The Mighty Nein after surviving their encounters in Darktow, traveling to and from Urukayxl and managing to release one of the gathered orbs of Uk'otoa's sealing. You made your way to the depths of the Diver's Grave and recovered the third of these orbs that you've come across. Two of which now reside within Fjord's person. You then proceeded on towards what you believed to be the location of one of these temples through a series of visions you've had by Uk'otoa. I knew it was coming. You made your way towards this archipelago. Looked around, set your ship in the center, cast Water Breathing on the group, and you all dove down beneath the waters and found this slightly angled ruin. This partially crumbled temple that sits there at the base of the ocean floor. You saw long, straggling pieces of seaweed slowly waving with the water and what looked to be drowned bodies tangled in them that upon your approach, began to clamber towards you. You fought off a number of them, managed to clear that space and then investigate within the interior of this temple tower.
