And they all look driven. And it's that cornered animal look that both is welcoming and also a little scary. And as you all walk in, they all very intently keep their eyes on you, their crossbows at their side. They're all surveying you and taking in and-- You can definitely see them accepting that you are powerful in comparison to maybe many of the others that they've encountered. And that also scares them. It would be like, 'Good. Fuck,' at the same time. And as you all walk in, in this sullen atmosphere, the one that was talking to you pulls his hood back, and you see it's a younger man, probably in his late 20s, but his face is just currently wrecked by some sort of a disease that's just scarred over.

You can see beyond that just a singular, black column of smoke, with the occasional flicker of red embers just drifting up through, fighting against the storm itself. The rain may fall, but it doesn't seem to last long enough to hit the ground of the Cloudtop. You see mist and steam begin to rise up; the rain is evaporating before it can even get close. You also see above the gate what looks to be a few dozen small, dark shapes. You take a moment to focus before you can see what looks to be-- what were once people are now blackened husks that have been left up on chains; decoration, if you will, for the outside of the Cloudtop. It's a warning, or a celebration of Thordak's rule. You see, on the outside of that gate, two large, armored, alert fire giants, wielding long, thick, square, black metal blades that themselves have flames engulfing.
