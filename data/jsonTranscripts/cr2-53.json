You do see there are a few places that have at least names attached to them, some of the huts or nearby buildings, those seem to be more prominent businesses here. It's unique. Having been in a lot of the central Empire cities, this city seems to be trying to build or create a semblance of that same type of civilization, but has a unique roughness to it that is both charmingly rustic and laced with a perpetual sense of danger. You do see there is a craft store that you heard mentioned before called Timoch and Ude Make Things. "

There are rafters pointed across, and there are different boxes and barrels placed up in the edges for storage reasons. To your right, there is a bar being run by a somewhat jovial, grinning bugbear that has mashed some sort of wax into very heavily-grown fur on the face, and pulled it into a tri-pointed moustache/goatee appearance; but it's just a continuation of the fur. He is in mid conversation. There are a good seven or eight tables scattered amongst the room, with candles on them that are burned halfway down with wax splatters across the center. The room is filled with all kinds of unique people. You see gnolls: one in the far corner and one to the far left, sitting there with large tankards, drinking and conversing. Probably a half-dozen goblins or so, scattered around the interior. Some orcs; a few Kryn drow in here as well. As you all step into the interior chamber, the energy comes to a slight standstill as everyone looks over to the brightly-colored and different individuals. "
