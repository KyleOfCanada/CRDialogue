You find it's a dwarven woman by the name of Karin, and they send you to her facility. It's a very small, almost a hovel, but when you approach the outside, you can immediately smell this strong scent of iron. Almost like a sulfur and different other chemicals that are used when you're folding metals and making composites. You open the door slightly, and it's very darkly lit on the inside. There's the heat of the forge, and you see this very sturdy, muscular dwarven woman standing in there with her hair graying, and it's pulled back into a very tight bun. She's wearing a leather apron with her sleeves rolled up, and she's in the process of hammering down on a piece of metal over her anvil, just (ping, ting, ting). "

You feel yourself internalizing all of the steps and missteps that you've gone through over these past six or seven months, trying to find your path, rediscovering yourself and what you have to do to prevent yourself or any of your friends from falling to the fate that you once did, and explaining to her that your love never left and that this was all with the ultimate purpose of achieving her ultimate purpose as her instrument, and you wish not to cross that again, and if there's any way to redeem yourself, to let it be known to you. At the end of that period of time, you feel since you've lost that connection in the Underdark, that thread reconnect, the warmth fills you, and the sweat stops as your entire body seems to be humming with energy. For a brief second in your face, in your eyes, in your vision you can see the beautiful gold, gleaming, fire-wreathed head of Sarenrae smiling at you as she reaches down and touches the side of your cheek and says, \"Be forthright. Be grand. Burn bright and beautiful, and I shall always be at your side.\" And with that, she releases your cheek and vanishes, the vision gone in the temple, and you can see two other clerics that were silent, muttering prayer, have gone quiet and are both staring at you with a look of like, 'what just happened.'

You don't see propellers, you see what looks like two almost wing-like protrusions on the sides of it, almost like two fans that open up that are probably used to guide pitch. At the very front of it, you can see what looks to be in the center of the ship one large ten to 15 foot-wide blue crystal that is embedded in the front of the ship and on the back two more that are currently attached to the back side. These stones slowly rotate in place where they are, and you can see there's this slight hum of arcane energy that seems to emanate from them.
