The channel gets thinner here, but thankfully after that last hit, you dig deep in yourself and be like, \"No, I've seen ships go through this, I'm getting the feel for this whole captain thing,\" and between you and Orly communicating, you manage to just make it through the channel. At a point, all of you hold your breath as you see elements of the reef that should be wide enough to put maybe a ship that's slightly larger than the one you have in, but with even just a small narrow margin of failure here, you would've ground against the side of one or the other side. You cut straight through perfectly, balancing on both sides, coming past the third marker beneath the surface, this one breaking through about a foot past the water.
