After retrieving one of these sought-after orbs from this long-reused temple by the snake folk on the island, and apparently unlocking one of these seals, you made your way back to Darktow on her ship, did a bit of piracy. Arrived, were introduced to the Plank King, who looks over the Revelry, the band of pirates that helm this side, pardon me, of the Lucidian Ocean. You then decided to have a plan to break into the Squalleater at night while everyone was at rest, or some of you at rest. Some were distracting the captain. In doing so, you managed to uncover a well-hidden journal of Avantika that was written in some sort of a cipher. "

You come past some deep sea corals and beautiful colorful visions and schools of fish scooting and coasting around. At one point, they swarm past you, and you feel them tickling past your torso before they skitter past. Eventually, this lift begins to descend into a small bowl or at least a point where the shelf begins to head in a downward direction at a decline. Within the next 15 or so minutes of traveling in that direction, you see the outline of a familiar ship. "
