A couple of our members have been closely watched by the Crownsguard ever since. So we believe the High-Richter might be in on it.

After we forge a little of the correspondence to this unsavory individual who he was speaking to in this letter, we make a new one that writes about an assassination of the High-Richter, sealed, and signed by the Lord Sutan. Then, we infiltrate the home of the High-Richter, tear apart her living space, look like it's been tousled and tossed, like someone was seeking her while she was out for the night, at a local ball, which she'll be one night from here. Before she returns to find her place destroyed, we take this letter that we found and left it, hidden within her room.
