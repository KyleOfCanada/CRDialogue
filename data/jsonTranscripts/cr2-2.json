They were invited to a nearby carnival that had begun preparing for their performance later that evening, in which they met Yasha and Molly. After swapping some stories, earning and losing some gold, they began to gather at the outskirts of the Ustaloch, the lake right on the eastern edge of Trostenwald, for the first opening performance of the Fletching and Moondrop Carnival of Curiosities.

You all, grabbing your weapons from Yasha, who had been keeping them stashed away, leapt into the fray, slaughtered both of these terrible beasts, just in time for the crownsguard to rush in and ask you what the hell happened. After information had been gathered of who was immediately available and responsible for this carnival, Gustav, Bo the Breaker, and Molly were marked to be arrested. One of the guards was escorted outside of the tent by Yasha, who was going to show him where this young dwarven girl was currently resting, and upon being led astray to the wrong tent, she just ran into the distant hills and vanished.
