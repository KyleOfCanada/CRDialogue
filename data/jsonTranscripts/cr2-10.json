Far Cry 5 is available on March 27th on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Go to farcry.com-- we don't have any computers here-- to learn more and pick up a copy. The latest installment of Far Cry is set in fictional Hope County, Montana, where a fanatical doomsday cult known as the Project at Eden's Gate has taken control. You are the hero of the story in a thrilling world that hits back with every punch and where the places you discover and the locals you ally with will shape your story in ways you'll never see coming. Also, in celebration of the upcoming release, Nerdist's Dan Casey, Kyle Hill, and Geek & Sundry's own Erika Ishii are filming a special Far Cry 5 training video where they took on challenges players will face in-game.

If you have the opportunity, look into it and see if you can provide any sort of funds to what they do or go ahead and give some time to them. Teach and be part of that wonderful environment.

Jester did so. She got a room at one of the hoity-toity inns in the district and was led to some mild disappointments. Where we left off, the two of you had reconvened and begun making your way back to meet up with the rest of your friends at the Leaky Tap tavern. Probably at a brief distance from each other as Caleb has huffed off, in a bit of frustration. Eventually, Caleb, you make your way to the familiar outside of the Leaky Tap. You enter, the fresh mud now a little bit less fresh and dried against your face, into the interior. At this point, it's mid-afternoon, there's maybe about, let's say, nine patrons in there, and a number of your friends who have been waiting for the two of you to return that are all sitting around a table and discussing amongst themselves. The rest of you guys look across and watch Caleb enter, and then a few moments after, Jester enters as well. "

You can see what looks to be maybe 15 or so feet across, from side to side, 15 to 20 feet from this wall to the other, slick stones, a slight curvature that leads into a base where there is a small ditch or a basin where old liquid is trickling through. There is a mild decline heading away from the direction you are and a mild incline heading in the direction of the Tri-Spires. The smell is not pleasant, but you're a tough chick, it's never been an issue. So you get yourself down, and it's no more than ten feet to climb to the base of this at the moment.
