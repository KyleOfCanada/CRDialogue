You guys do-- As the midday rain is still pouring down and it's causing the surface of the river to spatter, you can see there's a little bit of what would have been a morning marine fog that's been burning off since it went out there so it's no longer really at your disposal. However, you two do notice, right across the river against the bank before it rises up to the top of the city itself, you see, barely visible, the outside of a metal grate. Some sort of a subterranean sewer or tunnel system that is sealed shut across the way. It's a good, say, 80 to 100 feet across that river right now and it does have quite the current to it, probably because the rain's been pouring for most of the morning. "
