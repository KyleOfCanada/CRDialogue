First and foremost, we have under an hour until the sale for the temporary special edition #IsItThursdayYet shirts are no longer available. We're pushing in the mid-900s, and see if we can hit a thousand before the hour is up, guys. So if you haven't got one and you're interested, we'll have information in the chat for it. That's our hashtag Is It Thursday Yet shirts soon will be gone forever. So grab one if you want. Also, this marks the anniversary of Team Hoomanism. You guys have been amazing since the beginning of the whole community, through Felicia and starting the whole stream thing. It's been amazing to watch this whole community come together, and part of that celebration for today is go out there and tweet hashtag-- What's the hashtag on this one, Luke? "

Just go ahead and tweet with that hashtag, and at some point during tonight's show we're going to be giving away one of our Critical Role shirts that I'm modeling for you, strangely, accidentally for this, but I figure now you know what it looks like on a relatively unfit male.

We'll have that shown at the break today.
