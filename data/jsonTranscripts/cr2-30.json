Thanks to their Kickstarters and their update from dwarvenite to resin, I was able to find them more affordable, and I love using it. They're big time Critters as well. They've been invested in the show, and they're also general leaders in hand sculpted and painted terrain sets. I love them, and they launched another Kickstarter recently for their Caverns Deep! set, which is awesome. It offers 15 different distinct encounter areas, like, as it says here, the Webbed Lair, the Mushroom Grotto, and a brand new forest terrain system called the Dreadhollow Forest, which me and Liam got unveil at Gen Con in a live game, that looks so fucking cool!
