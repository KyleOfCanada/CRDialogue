For a free DLC download, you'll be able to download the portraits of Vox Machina as well as voice sets to use in the game for your main character and entire party. Check it out if you haven't had a chance yet. It's an awesome RPG series. Unbiased as I couldn't possibly be because I was one of the first Kickstarter backers before I was even part of the game. It's great. I really enjoyed it. Check it out if you can. It comes out next week on Tuesday, May 8th. You can order it at versusevil.com/criticalrole. They've released almost all the portraits so far, just in the past couple of days. They've released Keyleth and Grog today. "

There is a pedestal with a barker or an organizer up there in a long dark gray and brown set of robes, a human male in his late 50s who's fighting his own age and losing. The comb-over thinning hair and a broom-like gray mustache that's poorly colored with dark wax. He's shouting out to the crowd, he says, \"Please enter slowly, the event begins \"shortly in the next few hours. Would you push aside-- (muttering) Yes, right! This way, please, \"but go evenly!\" He's pushing off two different directions. What are you guys doing? "

The older gentleman ushers you over and waves in the distance as a figure begins to approach. This is another human man in probably his early 60s or so, who has graying hair that is slicked back and even further thinned than the gentleman who first met you on the way in, who has a very well groomed goatee that comes to an accentuated curve up underneath in the front.

Immediately bursting through, you see a large, nine-foot troll with elongated arms and legs start rushing into the fray, screaming this high-pitched yelp. As it runs, you can see its skin, as opposed to the deep forest green that you've read about or seen in trolls in your experiences, this looks like a dull teal-blue color. You watch as the dwarves, all of a sudden, rush in. The gnomes begin casting spells, and this assault goes back and forth. You see with each strike this cold mist off the claws of the troll with each blow. You watch as the gnomes begin to apply fire upon fire, and you watch as the entity burns, their intelligent knowledge of the creature causing it to prevent it from regenerating. Fairly rapidly, they make short work of it. They were prepared, and it was not as intense a battle as you were expecting. With that-- "

He limps away as it spins around, its tail slapping one of its friends, sending him flying back ten feet as his weapon goes skidding into the sky. It hits the dirt off the way. He runs to try and retrieve it. The battle goes back and forth for a while. One of their friends goes down and one of his allies grabs and pulls him away from the battle zone as he begins to try and wake him up. At this point, you watch as Darrow makes a couple of motions to his friends, and they all cycle in and assault at one time, cutting at the throat of the large crocodile as Darrow takes his axe and carves out one of its eyes. As it pulls back, screaming in pain, they both come underneath and cut through the throat at the same time, causing it to bleed out. With that, the crocodile collapses, not moving, into the field. "
