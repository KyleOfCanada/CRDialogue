There's some sort of magical essence about this creature's construction. That ends your turn. This entity here is going to step forward, and you can see it brings its fist up for a second. There's a small gem that's embedded in one of the stone fists, and you can see it's pulsing with stored energy. It puts the fist forward as the rakshasa in the background as Hotis instructs it and points forward towards you guys. It puts the fist forward. The gem glows red and then releases a very familiar-looking bead of red energy. "
