Also, The Wayfarer's Guide to Eberron, alternate title, The Werfernder's Gerd to Erberron, available for purchase now on the D&D Beyond marketplace. As a reminder, anyone who already has purchased the Legendary bundle can pre-order or purchase these and any future content at a 15% discount, everyone. Which has the savings baked right in. I've been using D&D Beyond for a while now, and they just redid their layout, took me a while to get used to it. For those of you at home using D&D Beyond, I have a couple of tips, pointers, for the new layout, to remind myself where things are layed out. It's like little mnemonics. It's a weird thing. On the right side of the screen, you can remember \"L E F,\" so right sort of like, LEF, left, sort of. That's where loot, equipment and features are. On the left, is \"I A A,\" insight and awareness. I'll put that down here. Then in the middle, is \"A T R,\" which is things you can add to roll. ATR. "

That'll be at twitch.tv/criticalrole. Talks Machina, our after show discussion about what happens this week will be happening next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here on the Geek & Sundry Twitch and Alpha, where our fantastic host Brian W.
