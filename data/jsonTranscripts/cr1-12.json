So, for most RPGs, especially those in the fantasy realm, this will be a very familiar aspect where there are many different game types that run different things, but usually the point goes you choose a race and you choose a class. The race defines your physical background, your family bloodline and what attributes that adds to you. A class is essentially the job or the way you've lived your life going forward and what skills you've acquired because of it. So, throughout the Player's Handbook-- you can go ahead and turn through the first few pages; first couple sections. You'll see there are certain races like the dwarf, whom I love.

You know, don't be afraid to have players in a city environment still find creepy, interesting, weird terrain within that city environment. In Emon the players managed to fall through a cistern into a deep, dark underground cavern network that led them through an ancient ruined city, finding a hag that managed to make a proposition with them, whereas for information leading them out she took a bit of Tiberius' luck-- he still doesn't know what that means and it still floats above his head. I think he's forgotten about it, but a portion of his fortune has been stolen by this hag, it still resides in that realm.

Another big thing to consider for Fifth Edition is, and you guys went over it a little bit, backgrounds. Not necessary. Players that are new to the game might find it very interesting, but when you ask about your character's background and what they've done, where they come from, and how that builds them as a character, you can completely come up with whatever you want to. You can say they came from this background, they did these things, and this is all in my head in how I plan the character. Some people either are having a little bit of writer's block with their character or they don't know where to start or they just don't have a lot of experience, there's a great section in the new Player's Handbook about backgrounds, which you get to choose where your character comes from, where they grew up. They could be a folk hero, they can be a charlatan, they can be an acolyte, they can be a soldier from a war long past. They can be an entertainer, and that gives them bonus proficiencies in their skills that pertain to their background, and it gives you examples of certain personality traits that you can choose or randomly roll from. For example, go to the background section of the Player's Handbook over here, you can find-- where is it? "

Bonds: things that really hold them, you know, via loyalty or to an ideal beyond that. And then flaws, which I love.

So, you wanna make sure you don't want to give too out too many items throughout the campaign quickly because then the players either get too powerful, and then any items you give them down the road seem not as interesting or flippant. I like to run a campaign that has, you know, occasional upgrades, just a little slow trickle with bursts of good item use, that way when you, they do find something truly magical, it's a, \"Aw, nice!\" as opposed to, \"Oh, \"it's another boots, who wants the boots? That's-- I've already got like three, here, you have that.\" You know. It becomes less interesting and less special to me, so I like to trickle them out and keeping tabs on what players have, what they're missing, and then eventually kind of incorporate aspects of what they can upgrade their characters with down the road.

You mention to the players, guys, going forward, I would love for us to be a little more into the circumstance. If you're feeling comfortable, please feel free to speak in character, or sometimes, if they're down for it but they have a hard time committing, put the law down. Anything you say in this game is in character if it's conversational. To where if they turn to somebody on the side and be like, \"I can't believe you stabbed them in the back,\" be like, \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" And then you start treating everything as character conversation, then they are put into a circumstance where they have to treat it like that. It may not be comfortable at first, but just like getting into the very, very cold water in a pool, at first it sucks, but over time they get used to it and they don't realize that they're there anymore after a while, you know, it just becomes natural. But for you as a Dungeon Master, you really have to, it's an invitation, a comfortable invitation, please come with me on this, I'd love to have you be more involved in this, and it's your job as the Dungeon Master to also bring your NPCs to life in the way you want them to roleplay, and when you ask them a question, don't ask it out to the whole group, pick somebody in the group that NPC's looking to and go, \"You!

But it's one of those circumstances where you have to be patient. And honestly, you can simplify the rules. When I say you can customize anything in this book, you can leave out a lot of the rules and just keep it very simple. If you don't want to have, if you think a movement, an action, and a bonus action's too much? Get rid of the bonus action and just consider things, find another way to work it in. Or if you want to keep it a little more free-form and just keep it open to-- it puts a little more work on you as the DM to do so, so you have to rationalize what they're doing so it doesn't seem so broken, but you can just minimize a lot of the rules, you can cut out half the skills if you don't think they're necessary. You can get rid of feats, you can get rid of backgrounds. You can halve the spell lists, if you want. If you want to narrow it down, you can go through and trim and trim and trim until you think you have a nice, simpler system for everyone to start with, and then you can start rolling out the more expanded aspects of the system. So don't feel like you have to verbatim hand everyone this book and be, read it all, let's go! You can go ahead and pick the few rules you think are important to play the game, teach them to your group and just start with those, and then slowly as time goes on let them research and discover more as they go on.

You mention to them that there is a place, a grand place where this temple could be found, and deep within resided the secret of contacting and being taken into the riches, the eternal vault of what is the Overlord. Upon this agreement, a small bit of change was exchanged, you managed to finagle the local stable out of a couple horses and found your way traveling before daybreak. You ride and ride and ride for the next two days. An awkward series of camping circumstances allow you to find you don't have a lot in common based on conversation, other than the love of money, and the love of this promise they give you. And the further you travel, the more and more the baneful eye of mistrust begins to fall upon one Snugglelord. As the beads of sweat drip down your face, but you know the city is mounting soon, there will be a time where you can prove to them that, in some way, shape, or form, they have helped you find what it is you're seeking and you can possibly kill them before they have the chance to take you out. Nevertheless. As the second sunrise hits, you crest over the last of a large, hilly landscape, the high grass brushing past your boots as you push through these grasslands, and you see upon the fabled city of Rockmarr. Rockmarr, not really that fabled, it's a small farming village, he seems to be talking it up as this grand city. So there's a moment of disappointment as you look over and see what may be anywhere from 60 to 70 houses to hovels to a slightly dilapidated farmland. Bit of confusion hits you and you look over to Snugglelord as he puts his hands up. "

Looking at the structure of the stone, the way it's built and carved and wedged together to form the almost brick-like pattern of its making, it's definitely not dwarven in make, but it looks very old, and it looks like the material itself is almost like a sandstone, and a lot of civilizations that long existed before proper stonecutting could be used, where stone could be moved from nearby mountains or even the dwarven stonecutting techniques were spread across this land, this was a very primitive way of building subterranean structures. You gather this interior is probably very, very old, well over a thousand years. And as you peer down into it using the torchlight, you can see down within the chamber, it's rectangular in shape, there appears to be a trough with some sort of liquid that is in an ovoid shape around a raised platform in the center, and in the center of this platform, on top of it, you can see a very, very dull blue glow from this crystalline spherical orb that is resting on it and is giving off this very, very faint blue light. And the further you walk towards it as you inspect the interior from the top of the hole in this stone structure, you hear that musical ringing sound get louder and louder as you step towards it. "
