A white, wild chinstrap beard marks his chin line, as a large metallic crown of cobbled golds, silvers, and iron adorn his head, fused with a tall window lantern that shines brighter than a lantern should. You see shifting movement from within the lantern, like the light source seems to be moving of its own accord, almost alive. A smaller, elderly kobold stands next to this wax throne with a tiny violin, and he's playing music as the kobold king sitting on the throne has his eyes partially closed, listening. You see, through the shadows of the flickering candlelight, amongst the various piles beyond your vision, apparently other kobolds are also in the chamber rummaging around, moving, organizing, placing goods they've received.
