You see stringy, greasy hair that's peeling in front of the face, obscuring part of one eye, the other one looks to be a bit clouded. You can see these like streaks of dark, what would've been possibly makeup, and beyond that, a leather tunic and these thick, rippling, muscular arms. She eventually gets over the side of the ship and then puts her hand over and helps the other two up. One of them appears to be a gentleman, probably in his late 30s, mostly bald, a little bit of hair on the sides, a light blond, and he seems to be a little more demure compared to the two. Immediately his gait and presence seems to be more of at least a lower position on the hierarchy of the other ship. The last one that comes up is the woman that you saw. This woman, she's a tougher-looking middle-aged woman, thicker, heftier body, weathered face. She's wearing tattered robes, but beneath that there is a set of leather armor, there is a cutlass to one side, and she has this small amulet that's dangling from a heavy chain around the neck. "
