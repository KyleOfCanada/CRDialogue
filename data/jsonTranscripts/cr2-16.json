Also, as part of the 826LA charity initiative, now that we're way past our $10,000 tier, D&D Beyond has offered up the discount code \"826LA\" for 25% off the legendary bundle. The legendary bundle includes all the digital materials available on the D&D Beyond site, so check it out now. A quick history lesson: I did some research. D&D Beyond actually, even though it's a popular modern website, it started in the 80s when D&D started to get popular. It didn't catch on because there was no internet, but they still had the website. They did an ad push for it and I found a script from their earliest ad that they put out. It's a little dated. It's a 1980s ad for D&D Beyond, and me and my friends here are going to act it out for you. "

Once again, from the great Pillars of Eternity series, I was in the first one and all of us are in this one. It comes out very soon, May 8th. It's in the same world, Eora. It's a really fantastic isometric RPG in the classic style of Baldur's Gate. The graphics are beautiful, and the music's incredible. You'd have heard the first game's music all through most of the Critical Role's run so far. It's a great story. For those that have finished the first game, it deals with the god Eothas who is now terrorizing this area called Deadfire. It's very pirate ships and oceanic island travel and it's pretty badass. You get to hear all of us in it and you also get to customize Vox Machina in it. "
