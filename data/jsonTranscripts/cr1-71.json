Just now have taken up in Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion, and are laying down for an evening's rest. So. As you guys wake up the next morning, or before you do-- "

Hits with the second attack. Hits with the third. Okay, so that's going to be 48 points of damage from Yenk. Slams a fist once and glides off the scales. Second one goes and slams into the side of Vorugal's neck, and then picks up the hoof and jams it into the side of the skull, cracking into the side of Vorugal's head. You can see some teeth break and get thrown off and scatter into the ice and snow nearby. At the end of Yenk's turn, Vorugal is going to go ahead and use two actions to wing attack once more, getting up. Let's see. Yenk's going to have to make a strength save. Fails. Kima fails, as well. They are both knocked prone and suffer bludgeoning damage. "
