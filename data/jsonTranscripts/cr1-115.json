It's a yin-yang dichotomy as the spell begins to take effect, until eventually the whole circle becomes pitch black, like the deepest of lightless midnight. At that moment, you watch as Velora's form itself is also cast into shadow and disappears from view. And for a moment, you fear she is gone, before the shadow begins to peel away like a cocoon, and as it tears and rolls back, the subtle sound of sand shifting and paper crackling, you watch as her chest begins to move once more, breathing, her eyes still closed, but life breathes into her lungs once more.

It's fine.\" You all take off the steps and begin to glide down over to the city, and there you can already see people are coming out of their homes. Exactly. So eventually, you find your way north to the Quadroads, towards the base of the Heaven Stair Mountain, where the temple resides. The temple looks like it's sustained a little bit of damage. It looks like a portion of the upper floor of the three-tier tower-- Colosseum-esque, but it does taper a bit towards the top. The top part has partially fallen in and it looks like it's seen wear and tear, but it doesn't look like it's been destroyed or anything. As you come up to the temple, you can already see there are refugees of homes that were destroyed from the incursion of the Braving Grounds that are being gathered in and the temple's filled with people. On the outside, you see Gesyra, the older woman who helped you found the temple and build it. As she approaches, she's now one of the Priests of Rebirth and has been working with you for some time and turns and sees your face. You can see her graying hair, which is bunned up very tightly in the back. She has her spectacles and she has the long robes of blue and gold. She sees you. \"My \"Pike!\" She rushes up and gives you a hug. She's much bigger than you, being a human, but her posture puts her almost on your level. \"I'm so glad you're safe.\" "
