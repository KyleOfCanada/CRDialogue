And you all had one wandering thread of Hotis, the rakshasa, which you have now killed twice and kept returning to the Nine Hells to recoup and threaten to come and slay and you and everything you love in the near future. So to cut that off at the head, you guys traveled to the second layer of Hell, the Iron City of Dis, to hunt down this rakshasa. After signing a contract with a devil, getting the proper information in this regard of where it was within the Bastion of Flesh in the subterranean prison known as Mentiri, you slaughtered a pit fiend named Utugash, and in response to that, as part of the contract, you were given passage into this prison with your equipment. You began a madcap rush through the prison, given the directions that you were presented as part of this deal you had made.

You all instantaneously feel the surge of magical energy burst through your body and all the chains that had tightened around, were threatening to crush your limbs and tear your body into a mass of crushed flesh and blood, release at once. And you have that familiar sense of floating and darkness once more. And you see that single bead of light ahead that grows larger and larger and larger, and that light becomes omnipresent, almost, in size, a familiar grid of divine fire and light. The Divine Gate, ancient and placed by the gods to seal both them, the betrayer gods, and any entities post-Divergence away. You transition once more through this lattice, impacting, the searing warmth just barely cresting the exterior of your form, leaving no damage to your soul, spirit, or physical body, but just enough to shake you as you pass through one of these small, porous holes in the gate itself. Glancing over your shoulder, you can see small little sparks that represent your friends who are traveling as well through this planar tunnel. As the lattice of the Divine Gate shifts and darkens behind you, you see a secondary small blue doorway come rocketing towards you all and suddenly your feet hit the ground. And as your eyes focus and look around, you are in the late afternoon, standing on the dirt ground, familiar scent, of a crisp, end-of-day Whitestone afternoon/evening. You guys are not at the Sun Tree. You are by the southern portion of it, not far from the farmhand who commissioned your portrait, Jameson. But the city is there before you.

You recall most of it, as most of the time you've spent in there has been in various states of intoxication. There's a beautiful hearth on the north end of the complex. I say \"complex\" because it's a series of rooms. There's the main tavern area in which the drinking happens. There's a small eating area that's separate from that, so they keep the localized tavern central area on its own. There's a kitchen, an open kitchen, so all the smoke and the food smell comes just barreling through. It's pretty sparse, mainly because a lot of the people are in the process of helping with the tavern, or they just haven't quite hit that point in the evening. Dusk is when people start finishing their work for the day, and they usually come in in the next couple hours or so. But you do see a couple of the Pale Guard are currently just taking a break. There's a handful of farmhands that are just in there, finishing a small breakfast and having some drinks. There's the bartender and a few bar handlers, a barmaid just waiting for customers to come in. And as you enter, immediately she goes from leaning on the back wall. \"Oh, hah, sorry!\" And she comes up and shows you guys to-- \"Any table you like!\" "
