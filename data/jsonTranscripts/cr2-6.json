I retweeted because I thought it was awesome, and they came up with the idea to make scarves for Caleb-- But not for me-- to give to shelters: Homeless shelters, to veterans, to anyone who needs scarves or hats or mittens. I think it's a great idea, and you would make me happy. This is beautiful, I love it, thank you, but don't pile me up in scarves. Send them to people who need them.

Last we left off, our gathering of friends have been traversing northward along the Amber Road, with the distant destination of Zadash, one of the larger cities of the Dwendalian Empire, as your destination. Upon traveling, you passed a caravan, spent an evening amongst trees, where you found a wayward cluster of wandering buffalo...-like creatures. You continued northward for a second day, rushed on past sunset to rest in the city of Alfield, a small farming town that's along the way to Zadash. However, upon noticing that some of the buildings in the eastern side of town began to light up with flame, you began to approach rather rapidly, seeing members of the city, citizens fleeing and screaming, and there seemed to be some sort of attack. Upon going into the town, you realized that a number of these buildings are being set fire by an incursion of gnolls. You were immediately brought in by Watchmaster Bryce, who offered to pay you for each set of gnoll ears that were brought to them, and you jumped into the fray, managed to kill quite a few, many of them still left with their quarry, it seems, which happened to be quite a number of bodies and/or citizens still living, that were dragged off into the ashen and cloud-covered night. Upon returning, many of you bruised, beaten, and at one point in danger of worse, you were given an evening's rest at the Feed and Mead Tavern, and were told, if you were interested in pursuing future coin in helping with the current conflict nearing the city, to meet Bryce out by the Broad Barn.

It seemed much more dangerous and chaotic last evening, but looking at it now in the day, it's no more than maybe a dozen buildings or so that were affected. They were more centralized to cause the most chaos suddenly at that time of night. You get the sense as soon as you look around that the folks of the city are on edge, understandably so. You see the people are trying to pick up their lives and move on in the face of what recently occurred. The very air holds this tension as you look around you. People walk past you with sacks of grain and tools, their eyes wide, darting around for unseen danger and glancing past the two tieflings, immediately, instinctually step back a bit and make a wide berth. You watch children run from doorway to doorway, trying to stay out of the street as long as possible. It seems like it's trying to carry on, but it's going to be a process. Some folks are rummaging through the remains of the respective buildings. You glance over near where the central portion of your conflict last night took place, where the Candleglow Tavern is, and there you see, amongst the smoldering rubble of the inn, a single halfling man sifts through the wreckage, a crownsguard helping him lift heavier beams. You see as he plucks what he can of his former life from the rubble. "

A hood missing a jaw that's placed over the top of the head, sections of arms worn like a glove with the hand missing, sifted through. It seems that a lot of the body parts are discolored and rotting a bit, from what you can see from the candle light that's flickering across it. Long bonelike spines, similar to what adorned the armor of that pack lord that you battled in the middle of the city last night, are also affixed to the outsides and pierced through elements of the shoulders and head of this flesh gnoll hide that it's wearing. As it growls, mimicking the sounds of the gnolls that it seems to be residing along, the other gnolls around look, pacing from foot to foot impatiently (growls and grunts). Begins to speak louder and louder at this altar as it places a final wet stone on it. All the remaining gnolls begin to bark in unison together (bark and howl). "
