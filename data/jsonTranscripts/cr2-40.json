There is the early basis of magical runes, which is a deviation of Draconic as a language, and then there are ways that they've been altered and made more efficient. These are very old, base, early Draconic runes. As such, they hold a lot more very primal magical power, and usually are reserved for larger rituals and magics that are meant to last for very long periods of time. The nature of the magic on these runes, from what you can tell, it's a little hard to get the direct essence, but there is some sort of an abjuration-based magic. "

You're now gliding through the street along with the flow of the water, trying to keep above the surface. Caduceus being pushed along by little Nott, going (thudding). At this point, from one of the nearby building tops, you see two of these centurion yuan-ti see you guys pass beneath, begin giving out a call, and then shouting over in their direction pointing towards you. Your presence is now aware to at least a handful of nearby yuan-ti. Their weapons were either lost in the stream or not wielded of course, but they're beginning to pull out their things. You guys continue to ride this forward, you're leading the path, the way you can go.

There are some that are guardians of the world, some that are guardians of the elements within their own planes. There are many types of horrors and protectors throughout history. Thinking back to some of your studies, both historically and in cracking the tome of the occasional religious thing against your better will in your classes, there are some entities that were left in the wake of the Divergence: avatar-like entities, or at least creations that were meant to be an extension of the power of the gods. Some of them are guardians in the world, some of them still remain true to the religions or the gods that created them. Some, over time, have found their own interests. Some have grown obsessed with their own power without their creator and master to chastise or watch over them, and see themselves as a new god, even. Thinking back, you don't have all the information, but you do know that-- thinking back to the murals and things you've heard about Uk'otoa being said, Uk'otoa was worshipped by the Ki'Nau, which were the indigenous people of the Menagerie Coast and the Swavain Islands in the vicinity. Uk'otoa was one of these avatar entities that was created by Zehir, the Cloaked Serpent, to be one of its many ambassadors of power and one of its greatest warriors in the conflict of the Calamity. "

You get the sense that these other two entities might be similar relics of this time: powerful beings created before or during the Calamity and then left with their gods now sealed away to become forces of power of their own. You don't know if they've been sealed in the same fate that Uk'otoa was. But based on what you saw in that temple, they seem to be connected or at least, have similar structure of worship. "
