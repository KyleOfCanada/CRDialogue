D&D Beyond wants you to know that at 9pm tonight, the Waterdeep Dragon Heist adventure releases on D&D Beyond. That's 9:00pm Pacific. That's in two hours, so it'll officially be available for purchase through D&D Beyond Marketplace. Don't forget to pick it up in a couple of hours, set your alarms. We'll probably remind you when 9:00 comes around. But that's not all. The number nine is special for other weird reasons. This Sunday, September 9th, or 9/9, is the first game of the regular season for Travis' favorite team, the Dallas Cowboys. They're already ranked top of their conference, as much as it pains me to say. Travis, two years ago, they won nine straight games. Last year, they won how many regular season games? "

Oversized puppy paws that look soft and goofy, but the limbs themselves are a little unnaturally angular for a natural dog. You can see some of its fey nature peeking through in its features. Its ears are very tall and pointed, though wide at the base. As you start teaching it to blink, you watch as it prepares each time, and as it begins to figure out the commands and what you're trying to guide, the eyes begin to go from a dark black to a bright blue right before it blinks over here and the eyes fade from blue to black as soon as it manages to find its next location. Over the next two hours or so of you working with this, you begin to eventually develop the early stages of finding ways to command it to teleport when you want it to, although you can't really guide where it's going to teleport yet.

You can see tall cranes made of wood and cord and rope, some of them ten feet, some of them 25-30 feet or so, that are in the process of either loading or off-loading various materials from the trade ships that are making their way into harbor or loading up to leave in the morning. You see two or three larger guild buildings that tend to be the hubs of information for those that are coming from the docks. There are a few dockmasters that are walking around who are in the process of taking down information of who it is entering or exiting with their ships, making sure that everything is being handled, and you see a number of zhelezo that are also keeping a close eye. Torches are now lit as the sky grows darker, and there's one that's going through the city and lighting the actual oil lanterns that hang on these tall, thin poles that dot the city that have to be lit at dusk. One thing that does catch your eye is, right towards the center of this harbor where the Restless Wharf would be transitioning into what you know as the Open Quay, which is the other half of this harbor, there is a massive lighthouse that sits on this one bit of rock that protrudes where the docks come to an end and an element of the stone floor continues out before breaking off into a shelf into the ocean below. You can see this beautiful lighthouse. You know it as the Mother's Lighthouse. It catches your attention specifically, Caduceus, because the beautiful design of this lighthouse, while it seems natural and a gradual tower-like point on the back side, on the northern side, the southern side that faces the ocean has a 20-foot relief of the upper torso of a woman that is emerging from the lighthouse looking out over the ocean. A beautiful sculpture with wild hair that tangles and curls around the shoulders and then merges in with the stonework of this lighthouse, but what's unique is the way the lighthouse itself is placed as it rotates. As the light beacon comes across, you watch as the eyes of the woman flare up as the light passes that side of the tower. You recognize, the closer you get to this area, this large sculpture is that of the Wildmother, of Melora. That is where the Mother's Lighthouse title comes from. "

You pass beyond this archway, the original, occasional set poles that hold the oil lanterns that give the faint bit of flickering firelight through these dark cobblestone streets give way to much more vibrant, magical baubles that hover about ten feet above the air. They've already been set, and you see them give off a brighter glow, and the colors seem to shift. One of them has a whiter color but then slowly turns to an orange, then shifts to a green. About ten feet away on the other side of the street, you see another one that's colors are shifting but in a different pattern, so they're kind of complementing and also contrasting each other. At this point, too, you begin to see the streets-- while not as crowded as the wharf, people that are here are much better dressed. You see a carriage make its way by to your right, and you see a few folks that appear to be well-dressed nobles of some kind, wearing a crushed silk-type clothing that is bright blues and purples, and jewelry of all sorts of gems and colors. Compared to a lot of the drab decor that a lot of the noble families wear in your experiences up in the Empire, the cultural mishmash that tends to build here on the coast over time with so many people coming from so many places, it all has built this mixing pot of styles and ideas and self-expression, and it immediately is visible in the people that live here. You do notice, strangely, that there are a few townsguard among the zhelezo here. "

You see a male dwarf, probably middle to older age, red hair that tends to eventually expire into a deep gray at the end of this really curly matted beard. You see big, gold, thick earrings that hoop from each earlobe-- the weight of this heavy, thick lobe has dragged the ears to stretch a bit past the face. The hairline comes in a deep widow's peak, that recedes almost back to the top of the head before coming in, and there you can see, in a similar tangled tuft, the rest of his hair that coasts past his shoulders before it exerts into a strange puff. He is wearing a simple leather tunic over a work uniform, but three or four fairly expensive necklaces or amulets that clatter around as he moves.
