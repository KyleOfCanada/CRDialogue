The giant bear takes Trinket with one claw and slams him into the ground.

Is she your charge?\" And Trinket voices back, you hear the (bear noises) up to the bear, as you hear coming out, \"She is everything. Her \"life is mine. You take her, you take me, or we walk on and remember you as a kind soul.\" The giant bear looks down, \"Very well. If you are at her side, I take your charge, as well.\" And the spirit bear steps forward, passing through you, and passing through Trinket's form, and what feels like this rush of warm air. And then disperses into a series of sparkles. You watch the energy slowly drift down and fade into the ground around you, and everything gets quiet. The trees slowly creak back and open the perimeter of this forest around you, leaving you alone. And Trinket comes up and licks your face. "
