Whether that'd be us or anybody else you'd want to show some love to, costs you nothing and it's pretty awesome, so do it if you haven't. If you need a recap for campaign two, we're doing our Critical Recap episodes now with our fantastic Dani Carr, who is doing succinct updates and reminders for things that have happened in the campaign, or if you've missed something and don't have the time and want to watch live, you can watch Critical Recap and be right ready to go when you\u2019re here on Thursday.

A helmet that's form-fit black leather and onyx studs wraps around their head. It looks demonic, the brow plate sweeping backwards into rear facing horns. Their other hand is dangling, clutching a cannonball-sized, twelve-sided dodecahedron shape, about that big, that has a handle on each side. It's emitting a dull undulating grey glow. "
