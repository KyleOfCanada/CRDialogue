As you look up at the top of the temple, you see the wings unfurl, drift towards you, and you see coming towards you the physical form of the Everlight herself. Her darkened skin, her beautiful smile, her light hair leaving a trail of flame and gold and sunlight behind. She comes forth and drifts right before you and says, \"Then the time is right for us to meet. Come. Come \"and join me on the Island of Renewal, within the blessed fields of Elysium.

There was a betrayal to her in the Calamity and most of her following was annihilated. As gods, as they currently exist, their worship is what sustains their importance and viability in the various planes. She diminished, so her location, her home, has been kept from most existing scripture and worship both for her protection and those of her followers. So the existence of the Island of Renewal and where it may be have only recently come to your attention. The blessed fields of Elysium, though, they are a fairly well-known location in religious circles, and is also home to the Fortress of the Sun, the home of Pelor, the Dawnfather. "
