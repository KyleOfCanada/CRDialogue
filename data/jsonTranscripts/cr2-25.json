If you can't afford it right now, you can even put a dollar in there and we'll have opportunities down the road hopefully for you to jump in if you missed it the first round. But when it comes down to it, you get eight minis for Vox Machina, you get the Mighty Nein minis as well, another eight minis, with Shak\u00e4ste involved in there. All the Pumats as well, and the extra bonus features of Tary and Doty, all for $60. Which is a pretty fantastic package for the quality of these and for the collectable aspect of it.

She goes, \"Okay, \"so over that side is the Omnismelter.\" She points over to a cluster of a dozen or so warehouses that are scattered in a spider web-like formation that are connected by a series of hallways between each other and then towards a central piece. She goes, \"That there is where most of the foundries of the \"city lie. Where all the various mined ingots or those imported are melted down and utilized. The \"foreman there is a bit of a tool. There's the Armavault.\" She points to the far northern side of the mountain base and you see a 25, 30-foot tall by 60-foot across iron door that is solid and jammed into the side of this mountain. It looks like it's very well protected from this glance at the distance. From what you can see, there's maybe two dozen or so crownsguard that are stationed at its base. \"That's where most of the funds that are saved for the uses of the city maintain as well as \"a number of the not currently being used devices of war. Means of defending the city should it come \"under attack, if you will.\" Points over there. You can see what looks to be where most of this smoke and steam is rising from. There is this one large, two-story black tower that has a single column of fast moving smoke pouring out of it. You can see areas where the smoke seems to be pulsing or darkening and widening at certain places. She goes, \"That there is the Underbellows. That's \"where they utilize a number of the forges and furnaces for the factories here. They've harnessed \"some of the volcanic activity beneath the mountain and that maintains a consistent heat for the \"forges. Smells downright awful, to be honest. Over there's the Firemark Facility.\" She points over to a building that looks a little simpler. It's not super tall and ominous-looking. It's very plain, made of cheap metals. You notice all the buildings here are mostly metal, probably because there's a lot of dealing with heat, fire, sparks, and the last thing you need is any of these things to catch fire. She points, though, to the Firemark Facility and she goes, \"This is where they're \"developing a majority of certain explosive and black powder-based technologies.\" "

Sell a few things, a couple of their regulars cut in line in front of you, not paying much attention or caring that you're waiting patiently.

As soon as you step into the shadow of the entryway of this prison, you go from the industrial and somewhat colorless Iron Lot that you've been traveling through to this very low-lit, reddish, almost oxidized iron interior that is just shadow and torches. You can see these large support beams of metal put against the rock and stone that has been carved out of the interior of the mountain. It's just one long hallway that splinters off into a number of hallways to the right and left before it reaches the outside of your current visual range to make any more detail out of it. At this point, as you enter, about five more of the crownsguard follow behind you and keep you all as a small pack traveling. At this point, he begins to move forward and gestures for you all to follow, saying, \"This way.\" Leads you down the hall, scooting to the right and heads to the right at the very first branching hallway of the interior of the prison. Heading further down, there's a few doors that are open, and on the inside they appear to be empty, or there's a few other guards. On the interior, you don't see much in the way of crownsguard, you see a different type of guard. Similar garb, but more drab, and you get the sense that they're-- this is an internal prison guard, this isn't part of the paid, trained, citywide guard. These are the interior Hupperdook prison guards. No more than maybe another 40 or so feet down, there's a doorway that's open that leads into an office. On the inside of this office, which itself is also super darkly lit, you see two ember torches that give this very dull red glow on the inside of the room, so it has this somewhat ominous and dreary interior presence to it as you step into this chamber. The desk is facing away from you, and there you see an older and grizzled gnome, who is in the process of wearing these series of robes and cloak over him with these gold-colored tassels and epaulets that shoot off the sides, seems to be giving out an air of station and importance, even though it's just in the process of filing what looks to be either prison transfers or people that have been arrested and figuring out who's to be put in here and why, or whose business is going to come to an end soon. He's in the process of shuffling through papers before turning around to you and goes, \"All right, so, you have come to my \"prison.\" Stands up and turns around to you, clicking his feet together as he does so at attention, arms crossed. \"Hello. I'm the Wardenhelm Poppin. You have bothered me from my \"work, and I would like to know why.\" As you look at him, you can see his hair has receded almost entirely to the back, and what bits of clustered gray hair on the sides he\u2019s currently attempted to slick and comb back, and one large part of it is trying to cover the massive bald spot, but as he spins around and talks to you, with any sort of movement it wobbles and has to settle itself back into place.

Following that down for another 80 or so feet, that main open hallway comes to an end, and there are a number of other small hallways that protrude. The guards lead you down the one on the left. You can see two immediately that branch off on the far end of that main open way. That left-side pathway leads to a set of stairs that spirals down to a second floor. Then a third floor. Then a fourth floor. The fourth floor is the bottom of these stairs, and you're now probably guessing, from the time it's taken you to descend the spiral staircase, maybe an additional 100 to 120 feet below the entrance and the actual level base of the mountain. At this point, you continue down a hallway and there are cells to your right and left. As you enter the space, the cells are very well-fortified, and behind the bars, in the dark, dark red ember-like torchlight that faintly glows and lights elements of this hallway, as you continue down, you can see shapes, humanoid shapes locked behind bars, of all shapes and sizes. As you begin to pass one on the right, you watch as a figure lurches up to the bars, pushes up to the edge, and what faint bit of red light you can see illuminating a face that looks scarred by a large, heavy clawmark down one side, the eye glued shut from the healing process. You see this toothy, rotten grin underneath as a nasty smell of breath emanates from its heavy breathing, and as you pass by, it says, \"Hey. Are you going to come back, are you? Where are you going? Where \"are you going? Come back!\" And you walk past. One of the guards takes their shortsword and clangs it across the metal and goes, \"Keep back, keep back.\" "
