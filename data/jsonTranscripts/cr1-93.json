First and foremost, we have a survey that we put up a couple of weeks ago. It ends April 18th. If you happen to have an opportunity, please go ahead and put in your information, let us know where you're from, how much of the show you've watched, what kind of future things from Critical Role you'd like to see. It's us getting a feel for the size and spread of the community and it's very helpful and awesome. So you can check that out at geekandsundry.com/crsurvey. You'll probably see the link in chat as well, please do that if you haven't yet, that'd be awesome! You have until April 18th. As far as merch goes, we're still out of stock on dice, I believe? "
