There was an attack on Felderwin in the Tillage, and it seems that this individual was taken eastward, towards Xhorhas. You managed to find the collapsed tunnel that they had used to surprise Felderwin, tunneled your way through that barrier, and then continued to follow this pathway back eastward to pursue where they may have taken him. While you've gone through, skirting the top of the Underdark of Wildemount, you managed to come in contact and save yourself from a battle with a couple of ropers amongst the caverns below. You found yourself suddenly in the center of a network of kobold tunnels, and in doing so, talked your way out of a possible conflict. Made a new friend and ally named Spurt, who was a nice and excitable inventor who wanted to show you the way through the tunnels, here towards the end of his life, it seemed. "
