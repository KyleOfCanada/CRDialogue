Here the mainstay source, the bulk of military power in the center of the Empire makes its way to war. You see horses, siege engines, and large ballista on wheels all being carried and prepared for the journey to the borders of Xhorhas and beyond. With that, you pick up and continue northward, making your way long the Amber Road, towards to where the Bromkiln Byway carves off to your destination. First, I want to ask you guys: what pace are you travelling at? You can go slow pace if you try to be super stealthy. Normal pace is fine. Fast pace you go quickly, but you threaten exhaustion if you continue to push that way. "
