The roads themselves are slick and heavy with mud from the snow and rainfall that has managed to still seep in. You can hear hooves making their way through the mud as you push past the barrier. Now last time you were here, you recall seeing large numbers of military that had gathered of the Righteous Brand of which there are very few left, it looks like most have gone eastward and found their way towards the skirmishes you continue to hear about on the borders of Xhorhas and the Ashguard Garrison. The gates close behind you, and you begin making your way now free again in the Marrow Valley southward towards your destination of the Menagerie Coast.

You watch one thread, you pick one focus, and you can see it pulling along. And it brightens and brightens and brightens until it reaches, in that tiny little infinitesimal push, a burst of light, and it changes direction. And you see in that space where that burst of light had happened, you see seven other shadow-threads begin to emerge from that point that then fade away to nothing, the thread having now curved and taken a different path. A choice, a decision made, and a different destiny for whatever that strange thread is following. And pulling back, you now see the thousands, tens of thousands, millions of these that all wander in their own independent, solitary directions, some crossing, some parallel, some alone. And you wonder what all of this means, and what this has to do with the essence of this device, the powers that it seems to impart, and what it is that the Kryn Dynasty has designs for. You come back in to your moment on the cart as you're rocking back and forth down the pathway, hearing the hooves on the muddy-- now getting drier-- portions of the roadway.

As you reach the outer streets of the township, there are people coming up and down the various streets with carts and wares. You can see folks that are passing through, hopefully on a trade route. Some folks that look like they're stuck here. A lot of carts that are built up on the outside that are either waiting for some sort of sign to continue travel, or are still packing up before they leave for whatever their next destination may be. What would you like to do? If anything. "

We'll say, for the sake of brevity here, the first two days of travel, thanks to your tent as well and staying off the beaten path during times of rest, you manage to find some good hidden areas and no issues happen at night during the restful period. The second day goes by without issue. You do see a small grouping of merchants making their way northward with largely what is a chain of oxen. It looks like they have about 12 or so of them that are chained together and they're heading northward, having made their way through the gates, for some sort of a sale or trade. It's a curious spectacle as they come by. It's one cart and just a lot of oxen, giant horns, slowly making their way northward. As you pass around for the third day and fourth day, go ahead and make another perception check. "

There's pretty heavy interest in keeping watch on these borders, given the current conflict to the east. But you pass through safely, allowed by the crownsguard, and within a few moments, you pass into the Wuyun Gorge proper, and a wave of acknowledgement hits most of you that, for the first time, you are no longer in the Dwendalian Empire. So you pass by the six or seven carts that are in line, and there's arguments and frustration. Some of them are currently very vehemently arguing with the crownsguard who are holding them to wait their turn. You keep your heads down and continue forward. There, you start heading into this large mountain pass. Extremely steep at certain points, where the mountains seem to be have been carved down or bisected by some ancient cataclysm, whether it be the Calamity or some great natural disaster long before that. It seems to be a very unique, singular cleft down in the center of these two mountains that breaks the mountain range between the Cyrios and the Ashkeeper.
