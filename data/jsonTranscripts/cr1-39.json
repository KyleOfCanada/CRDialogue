A home that you guys had ransacked a little over a year before after finding a portal within that led to a dragon's hoard, as the previous person who lived there, General Krieg, was actually a dragon who had infiltrated the Council.

The mechanism that's required to lob an object for the mortar to be able to do any help with is going to throw off your ability to aim much with the pistol, going forward.
