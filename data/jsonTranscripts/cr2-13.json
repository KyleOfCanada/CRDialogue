Anybody with a Master subscription can do it, so jump on the \"L,\" take the Eisenhower to the Kennedy, throw back a PBR or a 312 and grab a deep dish on me, because life just got a little better with the D&D Beyond.

As you curve down, the light gets brighter from around the corner, until suddenly you look into a stone-set subterranean tavern. From floor to ceiling, it's about 20 feet tall. You can see there are two balconies that overlook it from the left side, and one that's barely visible around the corner, as the room opens up to the right of you. There's a table immediately down from where the spiral staircase ends, and there's a gruff-looking fellow sitting there looking up as you enter. He looks immediately defensive. The rest of the people in there are drinking, and not immediately paying attention. As you begin to descend the stairway, who all\u2019s going in? "

There's maybe about a dozen or so people in here, between the bartender, folks, and you can see two people are playing music on the upper balcony.

Their face is cat-like, with ears that curl up. This is a black tabaxi that has turned around the corner, and goes, \"Halt, friends. I do not recognize-- Lucien?\" "
