The next episode will be next Tuesday at 7:00 PM Pacific time, hosted by our fantastic Brian W. Foster, if he can get away from Lancaster long enough. He'll be giving out prizes for Gif of the Week, for Fanart of the Week, and all that fun stuff, so check it out on Tuesday.

Right now, the offer, once again, only stands for people in the US and Canada excluding Quebec because of weird giveaway rules and laws. However, tonight's prize is a Wyrmwood cherry dice tower with this fantastic cartography burned in of maps designed by our fantastic Deven Rue, who you may recognize, who's done the map of the Dwendalian Empire that we have here as well as other amazing bits and also designed the compass rose on our map. She's amazing. Her work's amazing and while this isn't available with Wyrmwood yet, keep an eye out because cool stuff like this might be showing up more often. So this will be given away to some lucky person in the break. Need to go into the Critical Role Twitch chat and enter only one time. Enter the key phrase \"Kegstand.\" So enter it once. Magnets, it's magic. So enter it once; more than once, you'll be disqualified and we'll announce the winner here at the end of the break so we'll see you here in a few minutes. "
