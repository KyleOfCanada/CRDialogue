# Critical Role transcripts archive zip download

This archive is constructed from the YouTube closed captions of Critical Role episodes made available by the CR team. The archive is made available, with searching, at https://kryogenix.org/crsearch by Stuart Langridge.

Various people asked if they can have access to the transcripts so they can do all sorts of terrifying natural language and ML analysis on them, so this zip file is an attempt to manage that.

The files in this zip file are the transcripts, as HTML. They are well marked up, so they can be considered machine-readable already, but for convenience a Python 3 script called tojson.py is also provided which can parse the HTML transcripts into JSON files for more easy ingestion into some sort of database or other.

This is a reasonably large file, even zipped, so please do not re-download it with every episode or it will be a large bandwidth cost to me, Stuart, and then I'll stop doing it. The HTML files in this zip are exactly the same as the ones published on the website, so if your zip download is missing some files, they can be downloaded from https://kryogenix.org/crsearch/html/cr0-00.html for each episode you need.

Ping Stuart on Twitter (@sil) if you run into any problems or you have suggestions.
