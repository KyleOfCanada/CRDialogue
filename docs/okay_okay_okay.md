## “Okay, Okay, Okay”: Who said it and When?

“Okay, Okay, Okay” has been said a lot over the two campaigns of
Critical Role. Looking just at the main campaign episodes, and only
during gameplay, it has been said 645 times to be exact\! It is most
associated with Ashley, but does she say it the most? And has the
frequency with which it is said changed over the campaigns?

#### Who says “Okay, Okay, Okay” the most?

| name     | count | attended |     words | per episode | per word | one in every n words |
| :------- | ----: | -------: | --------: | ----------: | -------: | -------------------: |
| Ashley   |   113 |      154 |   164,248 |        0.73 | 0.002064 |                  485 |
| Laura    |   254 |      259 |   747,586 |        0.98 | 0.001019 |                  981 |
| Marisha  |   176 |      267 |   592,528 |        0.66 | 0.000891 |                1,122 |
| Sam      |    58 |      260 |   589,054 |        0.22 | 0.000295 |                3,385 |
| Travis   |    17 |      256 |   538,567 |        0.07 | 0.000095 |               10,560 |
| Liam     |    17 |      265 |   604,671 |        0.06 | 0.000084 |               11,856 |
| Taliesin |     3 |      264 |   559,003 |        0.01 | 0.000016 |               62,111 |
| Matt     |     7 |      269 | 3,316,365 |        0.03 | 0.000006 |              157,922 |

It turns out that both Laura (254) and Marisha (176) have said “Okay,
Okay, Okay” more times than Ashley (113). However, they both were
present for more episodes, and have said many more words than Ashley. If
we look at how many times they said it per episode they were in, Laura
still comes out on top, averaging 0.981 “Okay, Okay, Okay”s per episode,
with Marisha and Ashley averaging 0.659 and 0.734 respectively. But if
we look at the total number of words they said, we see that Ashley
(164,248) said fewer words than either Laura (747,586) or Marisha
(592,528). Taking this into account, we find that 1 in every 485 words
that Ashley said was part of “Okay, Okay, Okay”, compared to 1 in every
981 for Laura, and 1 in every 1122 for Marisha. So while Ashley may not
have said it the most, she did have the highest frequency of “Okay,
Okay, Okay” in her dialogue.

Another interesting point is that if we compare the number of times per
episode “Okay, Okay, Okay” is said when Ashley is present versus when
she is absent, we see that “Okay, Okay, Okay” is said an average of 3.17
times per episode when Ashley is there, and only 1.37 times per episode
when she is absent. This is an average increase of 1.8 times per episode
when Ashley is present, but Ashley herself only averages 0.734 “Okay,
Okay, Okay”s per episode. This suggests that having Ashley at the table
results in the other cast members saying “Okay, Okay, Okay” more often\!
And a Wilcoxon rank sum test confirms that “Okay, Okay, Okay” is said at
a statistically significant higher rate when Ashley is present (*p* =
3.09e-05). However, as shown in the next section, it is difficult to
untangle this from the change in the frequency of “Okay, Okay, Okay”
over the two campaigns, and Ashley’s more frequent presence in the later
episodes of campaign 2.

#### Has the use of “Okay, Okay, Okay” changed over time?

We see in the figure that “Okay, Okay, Okay” was said at a fairly low
rate during campaign 1, and didn’t change much from start to finish.
Campaign 2, however, started at about the same rate campaign 1 ended at,
but increased substantially as it progressed. The most times “Okay,
Okay, Okay” was said during an episode was campaign 2 episode 69, when
it was said 19 times.
