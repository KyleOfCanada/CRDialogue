# CRDialogue
An exploration of the dialogue from Critical Role

### Projects

* [How does the use of emotional words change between campaigns?](docs/spiderPlots.md)

* [Does Liam play the saddest bois? A word sentiment analysis of cast dialogue](docs/sentiments.md)

* Word Clouds for [Campaign 1](docs/wordCloudsC1.md), [Campaign 2](docs/wordCloudsC2.md), and [Exandria Unlimited](docs/wordCloudsExU1.md)

* Bigram Analysis for [Campaign 1](docs/bigramsC1.md) and [Campaign 2](docs/bigramsC2.md)

### Acknowledgments
The dialogue data come from the [Critical Role Linkable transcripts](https://kryogenix.org/crsearch/). Last updated with data from campaign `r maxCampaign` episode `r maxEpisode`. Time stamps to delineate game play time come from [CritRoleStats](https://www.critrolestats.com/).

Huge thanks to the cast and crew of [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/).
