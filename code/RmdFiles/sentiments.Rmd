### Does Liam play the saddest bois? A word sentiment analysis of cast dialogue

Liam has a reputation for playing sad characters, but is this deserved? Does his dialogue contain more sad words than the rest of the cast?

To answer this I searched the dialogue from the show for words associated with a sad sentiment, and words associated with joy as a control. I then calculated the ratio of joyful to sad words for each cast member and plotted it.

`r sentimentJoySadTable`



We can see that while Liam is in the bottom half, both Travis and Taliesin have lower scores.

I also wanted to take a slightly different approach and look at for words with either a positive or negative sentiment.

`r sentimentPosNegTable`



Again Liam is near the bottom, but Travis still has a lower score.
